I’m not sticking up for the guy, but in my eyes, he was trying to do the right thing. He knew he was getting deported, but he didn’t know where he was going or how he should get there. He added that the officers had no interest in helping him, saying, “You’re released, you’re released”. Describing his feelings about the debacle Sim told Sky News: It’s scary how this has all unfolded, and how easily he’s been able to get out and then be around the public. He’s obviously not a secure man. He shouldn’t have been released and the fact there’s so many officers there – how come no one’s clocked it sooner?” He went on: “Someone here has messed up … I know someone has been taken off duty … But to me there’s got to be more people that allowed this to happen, not just one person …” Kebatu was freed by mistake at HMP Chelmsford on Friday morning instead of being sent to an immigration detention centre. He was wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be released on licence and handed a £76 discharge grant, the Telegraph reported on Saturday. Once at the station, a one mile walk from the prison, Kebatu bought a ticket to London at a cost of £20.90. A Greater Anglia rail worker told The Telegraph: “He got a ticket and then went straight through. We don’t think he did it on his phone. You can’t use your card at this station either. It’s not London. So he must have got a ticket and paid like anyone else. “My colleague who was here has given a statement to British Transport Police about what happened. They swarmed the place after. They spoke to people who were here.” The accidental release of the asylum seeker was a “mind-blowing” blunder, says the MP for Chelmsford. The Liberal Democrat MP Marie Goldman said on Saturday: “My mind has blown. How this could possibly happen?” She added: “It is obvious something has gone terribly, terribly wrong and we really need to understand what went wrong. “Crucially, we need to understand how to fix it.” Goldman also told the PA news agency she had been frustrated by a lack of communication from HMP Chelmsford’s governor, Mark Howard, and said she was “struggling” not to call for him to resign. Stephen Robinson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Chelmsford city council, said Kebatu must be located and deported “as soon as possible”. “This is outrageous,” he told BBC Breakfast. “Chelmsford prison is used to handling people who are coming and going because it’s mainly a remand centre, and so they should be used to dealing with this.” A delivery driver called Sim, who spoke to Hadush Kebatu at Chelmsford prison has told Sky News the “confused” offender was guided to the railway station by prison staff. Sim was delivering equipment to the prison on Friday when Kebatu was released in error instead of being handed over to immigration officials for deportation. The lorry driver explained to Sky News that Kebatu approached him and seemed to have no idea of where he was supposed to go. He came out of the airlock, and kept saying to the officers there, ‘Where am I going? What am I doing? I don’t know where I’m going and what I’m doing.’ He was holding a pack of paperwork in his arms, and his bag of bits … He knew he’d been deported. He came over to me and said, ‘I need you to help me.’ Sim, who still has the vehicle pass from the prison, said that after a while a member of staff directed the offender to Chelmsford station to catch a train to London, and “told him that he had to get on a train”. Police confirmed Kebatu was seen catching a train at Chelmsford railway station at 12.41pm on Friday. On Friday, Sir Keir Starmer called the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu “totally unacceptable”, adding: I am appalled that it has happened and it’s being investigated. The police are working urgently to track him down, and my Government is supporting them … This man must be caught and deported for his crimes. David Lammy said he was “livid on behalf of the public” and added that he had launched an investigation. Lammy also said on Friday that there was “no excuse” for the mistaken release, but that Labour had inherited “a collapsing prison system”. He said: Let us be clear, we inherited a collapsing prison system in which the last government was releasing people early and which our prisons were overflowing. And, indeed, we have a sentencing bill in parliament seeking to address that issue, and we have stabilised the system. But that can be no excuse for wrongly releasing an individual, a dangerous individual, into the community. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Kebatu’s release was “staggering incompetence” and called for a public inquiry. Chelmsford’s Liberal Democrat MP Marie Goldman told the PA news agency she had been frustrated by a lack of communication from HMP Chelmsford’s governor, Mark Howard, and said she was “struggling” not to call for him to resign. At this moment, there is very little we know about how Hadush Kebatu came to be mistakenly released. Prison Service sources said the release was down to human error. It is understood the prison officer who authorised the release has been removed from duties while an urgent investigation takes place. One prison source described it as a “disaster waiting to happen” because of the high volume of releases being processed by inexperienced staff, with dozens of prisoners serving different tariffs being released at the same time. A senior prison staffer told the BBC: “This is down to a series of mistakes probably because staff are overworked and in short supply. It’s not just one prison officer who’s to blame. That would be unfair”. Recent law changes mean that foreign criminals such as Kebatu can be removed from England and Wales after serving a shorter sentence than domestic criminals. Kebatu was automatically eligible for immediate removal as soon as he was sentenced because of the time he had already spent on remand. The number of prisoners released in error more than doubled in the year to March 2025, Government data has shown. Councillor Chris Whitbread, Leader of Epping Forest District Council has responded to the extraordinary news after the mistaken release of Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu. Councillor Whitbread said in a statement: I am shocked and appalled by the mistaken release of Hadush Kebatu. Frankly, I am at a loss to understand how such a grave error could occur. My thoughts are with the victim and her family at this deeply distressing time. They have shown immense courage, and they deserve our full support and protection. This is a serious failure of the justice system, and people will rightly be outraged. It is completely unacceptable. The public has a right to expect that those convicted of serious crimes remain securely in custody. Public safety must never be compromised. I sincerely hope Kebatu is located and returned to prison without delay. There must also be a full and transparent investigation into how this happened, and what safeguards will be put in place to ensure it never happens again.” Friday, 12:57 – The search for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu began after Essex police were informed by the Prison Service that there had been “an error”. Friday, 12:41 – The Greater Anglia London-bound train that Kebatu had boarded left Chelmsford and then called at Shenfield, according to train line data. Friday, 13:10 – The service stopped at Stratford where the Met Police say Kebatu disembarked. A police statement said that, “Officers worked throughout the night to track his movements, including scouring hours of CCTV footage, and this work continues today. “It is not lost on us that this situation is concerning to people, and we are committed to locating and arresting him as quickly as possible,” it added. Saturday, 11:30 – Responsibility for the manhunt was transferred from Essex police to the Metropolitan police. A former asylum seeker who was released from prison in error after sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl has been spotted “in the London area” after officers worked through the night to track his movements, Essex police said. The Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was jailed for 12 months in September for sexual assault and made the subject of a five-year sexual harm prevention order. The 41-year-old was meant to be sent to an immigration detention centre to be deported but was freed by mistake, it has emerged. Kebatu was found guilty of five offences last month after attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl twice, before sexually assaulting her, and sexually assaulting a woman and trying to kiss her too. He committed the offences just days after arriving in the UK on a small boat and taking up residence at the Bell hotel in Epping. His case triggered protests outside the hotel, which far-right activists sought to exploit, leading to assaults on police officers and 32 arrests. At his trial, the district judge Christopher Williams said Kebatu posed a “significant risk of reoffending” and sentenced him to 12 months in prison. The number of prisoners released in error more than doubled in the year to March 2025, Government data shows. A report by His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) said 262 prisoners were released in error from April 2024 to March 2025, up from 115 in the year to March 2024. HMPPS said in the report that releases in error “remain infrequent” and believes the rise is linked to changes in the law, and the early release scheme which Labour introduced in September 2024. Cmdr James Conway, of the Metropolitan police, said finding Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu is a “top priority” for the force. The manhunt is being led by an experienced senior investigating officer. He has teams from the Specialist Crime Command with expertise in tracking down wanted people at his disposal, as well as other resources from across the Met. We’ve confirmed that Kebatu got off the London-bound train at Stratford station. We are examining CCTV from that area and further afield, including on the transport network, to establish information about his subsequent movements. We will provide further updates when we can, but I hope the press and the public will understand why it would be unhelpful to the effectiveness of the manhunt if we were to provide a detailed running commentary. Anyone who sees Kebatu, or has information about his whereabouts, should call 999 immediately. The Metropolitan police has taken over a manhunt for convicted sex offender Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, as there is a “high level of confidence” that the asylum seeker is in the London area. Kebatu, who was released in error from HMP Chelmsford on Friday, boarded a train for London and got off at Stratford station, the force said. As a result, the manhunt was transferred from Essex police to the Met shortly after 11.30am on Saturday.\",\n                \"author\": \"Sarah Haque\",\n                \"category\": \"UK news\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/oct/25/hadush-gerberslasie-kebatu-manhunt-met-police-sex-offender-london-latest-news\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/521cda532783a48e7207a01affc98bf50e82d0d6/1032_439_2150_1720/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:32+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:36+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 158,\n                \"source\": \"theguardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Chelsea v Sunderland, Newcastle v Fulham and more football – live clockwatch\",\n                \"description\": \"Join Billy Munday for goal updates and key match action from the 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League and beyond\",\n                \"content\": \"Newcastle hit the post!

On the ball – guess the footballer Something to keep you busy. The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with the launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android. It’s a big afternoon at Hillsborough. After Sheffield Wednesday entered administration yesterday, their fans have rallied around the club and rejoiced at the exit of owner Dejphon Chansiri. Wednesday fans reportedly spent £100,000 in the club shop yesterday – with figures approaching that today. The seats spelling out Chansiri’s name at Hillsborough are also being yanked out. Wednesday, docked 12 points yesterday and now bottom of the Championship on minus six, are at home to Oxford Utd at 3pm. Having held a boycott at previous home games, the supporters are returning to Hillsborough today. Results and latest scores from the early kick-offs: Championship Coventry 3-1 Watford Ipswich 1-0 West Brom Portsmouth 0-1 Stoke Frank Lampard’s Coventry go four points clear at the top of the Championship and seven points clear of third. League One Bolton 1-0 Cardiff Mansfield 1-1 Wigan League Two Cheltenham 1-0 Walsall Fleetwood 2-1 Accrington La Liga Girona 1-2 Real Oviedo (75 mins) Women’s friendly Wales 0-1 Australia (35 mins) Women’s FA Cup Middlesbrough 4-0 Cheadle Town Fulham will be glad to go into this weekend with their manager still in place. Marco Silva was strongly linked with the Nottingham Forest job before Sean Dyche got it – and now he’s got to devise a plan to stop Nick Woltemade. Mourinho and Benfica managed to do that in the Champions League on Tuesday but that left Newcastle’s wide players free to roam, as Louise Taylor says: Benfica restricted the Woltemade to one touch inside their box but, ultimately, they could not handle Eddie Howe’s wingers, Anthony Gordon in particular. “We could not compete with their horsepower, their intensity, speed and physicality,” said Mourinho. “This tells me a lot about Newcastle’s true level. They are a team of giants and they have four lightning-fast wingers.” Silva, a compatriot and a friend of Mourinho, has reason to be worried, particularly as Howe says there is “much more to come” from his reshaped side. This is the first time Chelsea and Sunderland have met in the Premier League since the final day of the 2016-17 season, when Antonio Conte’s side lifted the title after a thumping 5-1 win. Sunderland have lost on five of their last six visits to the Bridge but they’ve had a couple of very notable victories there in the last 15 years or so. There was Fabio Borini’s penalty that halted Mourinho’s title charge in 2014 and a 3-0 drubbing in 2010 that included a fine solo goal from Nedum Onuoha and some spectacular dancing from Bolo Zenden. Some more on Marc Guiu from Will Unwin this week: Marc Guiu started the season at Sunderland, having found himself out of Enzo Maresca’s plans and needing to learn about life in the Premier League after a slow first year in England. As a teenager arriving from Barcelona’s La Masia, it was not a surprise that the striker needed time to adapt even if he made a few cameos along the way before the Black Cats came calling. Then Liam Delap got injured and Chelsea were in a bit of a vice, so brought back Guiu. Sunderland gave him two substitute appearances in the league and he scored only in the Carabao Cup exit to Huddersfield, suggesting he might not be primed for life at the top of the table. Since then, however, he has shown Maresca what he can do, playing a half in the win over Nottingham Forest and scoring against Ajax. He will want to continue on this trajectory. Lewis Miley keeps his place for Newcastle after playing the full 90 minutes against Benfica in midweek. Sandro Tonali is on the bench. Newcastle (4-3-3): Pope; Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Burn; Joelinton, Guimarães, Miley; Murphy, Woltemade, Gordon. Subs: Ramsdale, Schär, Tonali, Barnes, Krafth, Osula, Elanga, Willock, Ramsey. Emile Smith Rowe makes his first league start of the season for Fulham, with Josh King dropping to the bench. Adama Traoré also makes the XI. Fulham (4-2-3-1): Leno; Tete, Diop, Bassey, Sessegnon; Lukic, Berge; Traoré, Smith Rowe, Iwobi; Jiménez. Subs: Lecomte, Reed, Cairney, Cuenca, Kusi-Asare, Castagne, Kevin, King, Amissah. Marc Guiu starts for Chelsea. The teenage striker spent the first few weeks of the season on loan at Sunderland before being recalled after Liam Delap’s injury. Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Sánchez; James, Acheampong, Chalobah, Cucurella; Caicedo, Fernández; Neto, João Pedro, Garnacho; Guiu.

Hello and welcome to Saturday’s clockwatch. We’ve got two Premier League games coming up at 3pm (BST), with action at Stamford Bridge and St James’ Park as west London goes up against north-east England. Fresh from dispatching Ajax in the Champions League in midweek, Chelsea are at home to Sunderland this afternoon looking to gain some ground on the leaders, Arsenal. Enzo Maresca’s side can go within two points of top spot with a win – but, then again, so can the visitors after their excellent start to the campaign. Newcastle were also winners in midweek, making light work of José Mourinho’s Benfica. Today they’re up against Fulham, who are without a handful of regulars in what is approaching an injury crisis. I’ll be bringing you updates from both games, with a particular focus on Stamford Bridge, while keeping across events in the EFL, Scotland and Europe’s major leagues. Team news is on the way shortly.

He is put away again after some nifty hands and has the intelligence to throw a pass inside to Cleary. The home side are very lucky the scrum-half loses his footing as he was about to move the ball on to threaten the scrambling defence. 25 mins. There is some possession for England in the Aus half, but again there’s not a huge amount created in the face of the defensive efforts. 22 mins. You have to say that was coming. Territory had been dominated for a good few minutes in the England half, and this combined with Walsh getting himself more involved was causing issues for the tiring home defence. Farnworth appears to be OK after his knock earlier, but Aussie captain Isaah Yeo isn’t; he’s off after failing and head injury assessment. 21 mins. From just inside their own half Australia move right through fast hands all the way to Nawaqanitawase who gets outside the defence, offloads inside to Staggs and he feeds Walsh to run in and dive over the line to open the scoring. Two points added from the tee. 20 mins. England’s sets are starting to look more laboured and there’s worse news as Farnworth looks to have picked up a knock in the tackle. Shaun Wane may want to consider some replacements as Australia have sensed the drop off and have upped their intensity. 17 mins. Walsh is growing into the game and he rejoins the line once more in attack. This creates a three on two on the left side, but the fullback gives his pass too much weetabix to send it over Shibasaki’s head and into touch. On the next England set Cotter hammers Lewis to dislodge the ball on tackle three and win possession back for the Kangaroos. 15 mins. We have our first glimps of the Cleary, Munster and Walsh axis of attack coming together on the England 20m line. There are some clever patterns worked but the home defence don’t panic and contain the runners. 13 mins. Reece Walsh is penalised after he is adjudges to have not played the ball correctly midway in his own half die to falling over as he played it. This offers a great platform England, but Yeo immediately calls a captain’s challenge on the decision. The video ref has a look and the reason he lost his feet is because Bateman shoved the back of his head as he was attempting to stand up. Decision overturned, how important will that be? 10 mins. England have the ball back from Walsh’s slap into touch and move up to the Australia 20m line. Welsby is up into the stand-off channel to throw a huge looping pass rightwards to absolutely no-one; Dom Young had tucked inside and left only grass near the touchline. 8 mins. Finally, an attack of note breaks out after a big carry from Dom Young sets Williams running free up the right touchline. He spots a gap behind the line to chip the ball into which is gathered by Farnworth whose pop pass to Johnston is slapped down by Walsh as he defends desperately. 6 mins. The first error of the game is a spilled ball from Hudson Young in the tackle that gives possession to England on halfway. The story of the match so far continues as a few carries lead to the ball being kicked away as the defence from Australia is organised and furiously competent. 4 mins. Welsby runs a a wide channel on a kick return that nearly allows him to put Farnworth away on the left, but the green and gold door slams shut. There are more jabs and probing runs from both sides as we await the game to break out from the solid start. 2 mins. Australia receive the ball and execute a settling first set of six of the match, the forwards carrying up to their forty metre line before Cleary puts his foot through the ball. A similar story for England’s first set as the teams feel their way into the test match. Mikey Lewis boots the game underway. The teams are out into a cloudy autumn afternoon in London. We await the anthems and then the action. While we’re considering the previous Ashes series in 2003. The first test last time out featured GB’s Adrian Morley being sent off after 12 seconds for a shocking high shot on Robbie Kearns. It happened so fast the camera had not even zoomed in from the wide kick-off angle to where the incident happened. Here is Morley himself reflecting on it recently… “I looked at my kids and had tears in my eyes.” A lovely piece here about Leeds and England prop Mikolaj Oledzki, whose family arrived here from Gdansk when he was a child, and what it means to be in the squad for this series.

In rugby league, Ashes tests are like buses, come along as they do in threes very infrequently. Today is the start of the latest trio of matches after a 22 year wait since the fabulously sponsored “THINK! Don’t Drink And Drive!” series of 2003. Buses can also mercilessly run over groups of people, and Australia have made a habit of releasing the brakes on their considerable heft to smash opposition from these islands for 55 years. The Kangaroos have won all 13 series since the last British victory in 1970 and come into this year’s installment as favourites to do the same. A Great Britain team made up of a majority of English players lost the 2003 series to a whitewash despite leading all three tests in the second half; this was before the Australian class did enough late in each game to record an overall battering in that year’s sports almanac. The Kangaroos remain formidable two decades on, but England also have a greater number of players appearing weekly in the NRL down under than at any time previously, including the impressive Herbie Farnworth. The mystique and terror of the green and gold juggernaut arriving on these shores is not what it once was. Even with that, turning the bus around and claiming victory after half a century of trying remains a huge challenge for Shaun Wane’s England.\",\n                \"author\": \"Lee Calvert\",\n                \"category\": \"Sport\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/oct/25/england-v-australia-rugby-league-ashes-first-test-live-updates\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9c233e56689178c6589c4bfcf07020cab836282/747_218_3360_2688/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:05:38+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:36+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 160,\n                \"source\": \"theguardian\",\n                \"title\": \"For San Diego FC, a historic inaugural MLS season is equal parts philosophy and community\",\n                \"description\": \"The Western Conference’s No 1 seed can become the second expansion team to win MLS Cup\",\n                \"content\": \"As San Diego FC prepare for their first playoff appearance this Sunday, they do so with the deserved title of record breakers. The expansion club has earned the Western Conference’s No 1 seed and set records for most victories (19) and points (63) in a single season by an MLS expansion team. As a result, they will be at home for the remainder of the playoffs, and would host MLS Cup if they make it there and meet anyone other than the Supporters’ Shield-winning Philadelphia Union. Now, they’re aiming for more history – to become the first expansion side to win MLS Cup since 1998 when the Chicago Fire achieved it against DC United. “For me, this was always the objective,” Hirving “Chucky” Lozano told the Guardian. The 30-year-old Mexico international arrived in San Diego as the club’s first designated player after a great career with PSV and Napoli. He’s also been in the headlines this week, having been separated from the team for their trip to Portland on Decision Day – a decision that head coach Mikey Varas chalked up to an internal issue. Lozano later apologized on social media, hinting at a concept Varas had brought up when interviewed by the Guardian before the suspension was reported. “We believe that our collectivity is our superpower,” Varas said. “We say a lot to ourselves that we’re here to win, but how we win and who we win with matters. And that’s how we feel, really, at the deepest part of our DNA. [We’re] a team that’s relentless, that won’t give up and doesn’t stop playing the way that they want to play. And then a team that has a fighting team spirit, you know, one that, is always connected.” For San Diego, winning is not just a result at the end of 90 minutes, it’s a personality trait that comes with daily lessons. To do that, you need not just stars like Lozano but also great players that don’t earn as many headlines; like veteran Panamanian anchor Aníbal Godoy, San Diego native and USMNT’s Luca de la Torre (on loan from Celta Vigo) and Anders Dreyer, the 27-year-old Dane who came to the club from Anderlecht who has lit up his first MLS campaign. In his first season, Dreyer earned 38 goal contributions (19g/19a), thus becoming the player with more goals (17) and goal contributions (27) on the road in the history of the league. On Thursday, he was named a finalist for the MLS MVP award. The roster as a whole, though, has been formed under San Diego’s careful philosophy, which has its foundations in analytics and homegrown talent. Through data and other means, the pivotal strategy is not just to find the right players, but to build them. “Our academy will be the heartbeat of this club, and homegrowns, ideally, will be the heartbeat of this club,” says Tyler Heaps, the club’s general manager and sporting director. At 34, he is the youngest in the league to serve this position. “It’ll hopefully make my job a whole lot easier, in the future, because we should have this talent and development opportunity for these players, and then we will give them an opportunity in the first team.” Heaps points to examples of young players who are already getting significant minutes with San Diego, like first-round draft picks Manu Duah and Ian Pilcher and 19-year-old left-back Luca Bombino, who came on loan from LAFC and has had a great campaign. “Our style of play is also catered to set up for young players,” says Heaps. “It’s catered to some of the things that we do with our defensive shape, some of the things that we do in our training environment, to make sure that those decisions are a lot cleaner and a lot easier for our players to understand, so that they can go play on instincts and everything else that they’re taught to do from a young age.” Education at San Diego FC – on and off the pitch – is spearheaded by their centerpiece vision: the Right to Dream football academy. Founded in Ghana in 1999 by Tom Vernon, the academy has produced more than 100 professional players including Tottenham Hotspur and Ghana’s Mohammed Kudus and Ivorian Simon Adingra, who joined Sunderland this past summer from Brighton. The academy plays vital roles in regions such as Denmark with FC Nordsjælland and FC Masar in Egypt and it has been the driving foundation behind San Diego FC. Last month, the club’s state-of-the art academy complex, where the first team also trains, opened in a 28-acre site on Sycuan tribal land in El Cajon, about 16 miles east of San Diego. It is the league’s first ever integrated school and academy beginning at middle school age for boys and girls where each residential student-athlete receives a five-year scholarship regardless of performance. That’s a first for MLS and North America. Heaps was recruited and appointed by Mohamed Mansour, San Diego’s founding partner and chair who also owns Right to Dream through his UK-based family office Man Capital. Heaps had been working for Monaco from 2021 to 2023 before joining Right to Dream as head of recruitment and insights. “[Our vision] is about character development, holistic development, player development, staff development. It’s why I’m here,” Heaps says. The players at the academy, for the most part, come from San Diego and Tijuana, a mecca for young Mexican talent. In San Diego, where more than 30% of the population are Hispanic/Latino and the majority being Mexican-American, the strategy to recruit across borders is vital from both a footballing and cultural one. “[The American/Mexican recruitment] is critical for our player development but also for our club because it identifies with the essence of this entire region, which is this unique and deep cross-border connectivity,” says Tom Penn, San Diego FC’s CEO, who also co-founded LAFC back in 2014 and served as president. “[San Diego] is this truly unique culture that is truly southern California but it’s distinct from Los Angeles…there’s a unique rhythm and quality of life here. And everybody is grateful for that, they embrace the diversity of the cultures here and then there’s just real civic pride and a sports team can bring together that whole community around that pride.” Varas, who has a personal connection to San Diego as he met his wife Jessica here, agrees. “I just know San Diego really well. I know how creative it is, how diverse it is, but also how hardworking and competitive it is. They love their region, they love their community, and whether you were born and raised here, or you were a transplant like myself and you found your way here, you fall in love with this place, and then you make huge sacrifices to stay here.” For Lozano, who was born in Mexico City and moved to Pachuca when he was 11, the border culture is not something he grew up with. But he feels right at home in San Diego and also sees the massive benefits from being part of a club that strongly represents two very close cultures. “I think [the area] is so important because it can attract many players because there is so much talent, both in the US and Mexico, so to apply that combination is going to be beautiful and attractive.” But as far as he’s concerned, the recipe for success needs an outcome. First, it was the regular season. Now comes the second target: to win MLS Cup. “I think – and I have faith – that we can do it. We’re on the right path,” Lozano said. “I always thought we could achieve important things from the beginning. I came here [to this club] because of the project and everything that surrounds it, from the ownership and everything else, it’s wonderful and all of that attracted me to come to San Diego and that’s why I chose to come here.” Luis Miguel Echegaray is a writer, analyst and host specializing in soccer and sports content that also appeals to the US Latino and young audience.

And yet today people are sick with this ancient disease in 32 countries, with more than 6,800 deaths reported so far this year –already exceeding all of last year’s toll of 6,000 deaths, which was itself a 50% increase on 2023. The most severe outbreaks are in Africa, where conflict is accelerating the spread and hampering control efforts in some countries. Cholera is the definitive disease of deprivation. It persists not for lack of science or solutions, but because leaders have failed to act with the urgency and commitment the crisis demands. A consortium of more than 50 partners, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), is responding to these outbreaks through the Global Task Force on Cholera Control– a partnership established in 1992 to enable access to essential supplies, as well as work on the detection, prevention and treatment of cholera and set global priorities to sustainably control the disease. Complementing the work of the taskforce, in August the WHO and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched a continental cholera emergency response plan. Cholera is caused by a bacterium ingested in food or water contaminated with faeces from an infected person, and the only way to prevent it is by ensuring access to safe water and sanitation. This is why it is now practically unheard of in countries with those facilities, but thrives in communities afflicted by inequality, poverty, conflict, displacement and climate-related disasters. The disease can be prevented with effective vaccines. An injectable vaccine was first developed in the late 19th century, and was superseded by oral vaccines in the 1980s. But because the disease afflicts almost exclusively the poorest countries and communities, the vaccine does not attract investment from developers, for whom it offers little market opportunity. There is currently only one manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns: EUBiologics, based in South Korea. To manage cholera outbreaks, the WHO and other partners established a global cholera vaccine stockpile for outbreaks in 2013 under the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision (ICG) to ensure rapid, equitable and effective access to vaccines in emergencies, especially in low-resource settings. Since then, the stockpile has distributed almost 255m doses of vaccine to 34 countries. Almost 75% of those doses have been distributed since 2021, in response to the global resurgence of cholera. So far this year, the stockpile has disbursed more than 49m vaccine doses – already eclipsing the previous record for a single year. Given the increasing frequency and severity of outbreaks, vaccines from the stockpile can only be used to bring outbreaks under control, rather than to conduct preventive campaigns in areas at risk of cholera. The stockpile is replenished every week but production cannot keep up with demand, and it is regularly below the recommended threshold of having 5m doses ready to respond to outbreaks at any time. To stretch supplies further, the ICG suspended the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in 2022 in favour of a single dose. This was based on evidence showing that a single dose provides protection, but it wanes faster than it would with a two-dose regimen. Single-dose vaccination is only therefore a temporary solution to scarce supplies. Demand shows no sign of abating, meaning supply must increase. In October 2024, Zambia signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s Jijia Medical Technology Company to establish a cholera vaccine-production facility in Lusaka. The planned production will still require rigorous quality assurance and clinical trials to confirm safety and efficacy before any locally manufactured doses can be approved by the WHO and deployed in mass vaccination campaigns. While expanding vaccine production in Africa is essential for preventing and responding to outbreaks of this historical disease, the only long-term solution is for governments to invest in safe drinking water and sanitation. There are some diseases that cannot be completely prevented, such as Alzheimer’s and most cancers. But cholera is not one of them – it can be stopped. Cholera persists because poverty, inequality, conflict and displacement persist. Stopping it is therefore not a scientific, medical or technical challenge; fundamentally, it’s a political one.

Philip Langeskov has added to the earlier conversation about Norwich: “If Liam Manning is under immense pressure, so is our sporting director, Ben Knapper. After all, he sacked David Wagner after sneaking us into the play-offs. Most fans were on board, because the football was pragmatic to the point of invisibility. He then brought in Johannes Hoff Thorup, hailing him one of most exciting young coaches in Europe. A squad overhaul supported the young Dane, only for him to be sacked before the season was out. Liam Manning was identified as the solution, despite being more Wagner than Thorup. Cue another squad overhaul. Since then, we’ve been appalling. If Knapper sacks Manning, decency surely requires him to then sack himself. Either way, it’s an unholy mess. The more time passes, the more we come to regret the dismissal of that extremely loveable footballing philosopher, Daniel Farke.” Championship: Watford have got a goal back! Imran Louza strikes from the penalty spot. Rick Harris has given his thoughts and predictions for today’s Premier League games: “I think Chelsea may struggle to beat Sunderland, especially after playing in Europe midweek. More like a 0-0 or 1-1. Newcastle also played in the Champions League and Fulham are one of those ‘don’t know what you are going to get’ teams so this also may be a score draw or even an away win. “Brighton are United’s bogey team with wins at Old Trafford three seasons running, but Bruno is playing his 300th game and they finally got the successive PL wins money off their back with victory at Liverpool. Is this another false dawn? Signs are that United are getting their Mojo back so I think they will win this 2-0. “Massive game this evening to see if Liverpool can stop the PL rot. I doubt Brentford will be as accommodating as Eintracht Frankfurt were in Germany and Liverpool tend not to play that well after a European game. Brentford to win for me, Jeff.” League One: Wigan have equalised against Mansfield thanks to a 59th-minute strike from Oli Cooper. League Two: Meanwhile, in the league below, Ryan Graydon has made it 1-1 between Fleetwood and Accrington Stanley. Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso declined to comment on Saturday after Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal suggested the capital club “cheat” and “complain” in a televised interview on Friday. Instead, Alonso directed his focus to Sunday’s El Clasico at the Bernabeu, emphasising the importance of the match for his LaLiga leaders who have 24 points, two ahead of Barca in second. Alonso faced repeated questions from reporters regarding Yamal’s remarks, made during an appearance on a Kings League programme alongside former Barcelona defender Gerard Pique. The 18-year-old Barca forward compared Real to Porcinos, a Kings League team, stating: “Of course! Yes, they cheat, they complain ...” The comments, which Pique supported, stirred debate in the build-up to one of soccer’s most iconic fixtures. When asked about Yamal’s statements, Alonso dismissed the topic. “It’s an important match ... important enough,” he said. “It has many ingredients for us to play well, for us to enjoy it. And that’s what excites us the most, the biggest incentive for tomorrow.” Pressed further, Alonso reiterated his stance. “No, I’m not going to get into that. There have been a lot of statements from people in Barcelona and I can’t comment on them all. For us, the important thing is the pitch, what happens on the pitch. Where we’ve come from and what lies ahead. That’s what concerns me most and what we’ve been working on.” Visibly irritated when the question came up a third time, Alonso, who took over from Carlo Ancelotti at Real in June, added: “Are we going back to that? What I have in my head is that it’s going to be an intense and competitive match. “We have to be prepared because there will be moments for everything. The players have to have the necessary adrenaline. I’m not thinking about other consequences.” Alonso is determined to use the first Clasico of the season as a chance for Real Madrid to reclaim their dominance in big matches, a quality that has been questioned following heavy defeats by Paris St Germain in the Club World Cup semi-finals and Atletico Madrid in LaLiga earlier in the campaign. Last season, Barcelona inflicted further damage on their arch-rivals, beating Real four consecutive times across three competitions, including a 4-0 thrashing at the Bernabeu and a 5-2 victory in the Super Cup final. “The match has a special flavour and is the most important one right now,” Alonso said when asked about the pressure to perform. “There will be similar situations, but it is completely different (from last season). We want to maximise our strengths. “An El Clasico is special. The first one in this project. We need the stadium to have the energy of big matches, to push us forward. Looking ahead to tomorrow, we believe we are in good shape, both mentally and in terms of our football.” Jeremy Boyce says: “Sorry if Mac Millings and Mary Waltz aren’t enjoying the match today. Of course, Watford have their very own chaos ‘Marinakis’ owner in Gino Pozzo, who’s overseen one of the longest hiring/firing periods in footie with predictably chaotic results, none more so than today. They should count themselves lucky that they’re in the second tier and therefore it’s all happening under the radar for now. Who might they turn to next? I hear Ange Postecoglou is looking for work and might appreciate an opportunity for some low-profile rehabilitation employment.” Barcelona will face LaLiga leaders Real Madrid in Sunday’s El Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu without their Brazil forward Raphinha, assistant coach Marcus Sorg confirmed on Saturday, as the Catalan side grapple with an extensive injury list. The 28-year-old Raphinha, who has not recovered from a leg muscle injury, joins a host of high-profile absentees, including Dani Olmo, Robert Lewandowski, Gavi and goalkeepers Joan Garcia and Marc-Andre ter Stegen. With 10 players sidelined since August, Barca’s injury crisis has left their squad severely depleted ahead of one of the most crucial fixtures of the season. Despite Raphinha’s setback, the Spanish champions remain optimistic that they can count on key players Ferran Torres, Jules Kounde, Andreas Christensen and Frenkie De Jong, who all took part in Saturday’s team practice. “Any team would miss Raphinha, but the situation is what it is. He is injured,” Sorg told a press conference. “We’ll see if Ferran (Torres) starts, we’ll decide tomorrow. Jules Kounde also trained this morning and may play. I still have no idea about the starting eleven.” Torres left Spain’s camp early with leg muscle fatigue, while De Jong missed three training sessions this week due to illness and Kounde was forced out of the 6-1 win over Olympiacos in the Champions League in midweek after a blow to the leg. The injuries further complicate the Catalans’ selection headaches for the crucial encounter against Real Madrid, who sit two points ahead of second-placed Barca after eight games. Mary Waltz has messaged in from California to say: “Pitch dark greetings from California. What a strange game for Watford. Multiple lovely scoring chances for the Hornets all for naught. Down 3 goals and now a red card.” Championship: Portsmouth 0-0 Stoke City Coventry City 3-0 Watford Ipswich Town 0-0 West Brom League One: Mansfield Town 1-0 Wigan Athletic Bolton Wanderers 0-0 Cardiff City League Two: Fleetwood Town 0-1 Accrington Stanley Cheltenham Town 0-0 Walsall Championship: When it rains, it pours. Watford are down to 10 men. James Abankwah sees red for a last-man challenge on Haji Wright. Championship: And it’s 3-0 to Coventry thanks to a low-driven strike from Tatsuhiro Sakamoto. Is there any way back for Watford now? Dan Christmas has messaged in to say: “Re. Liam Manning under pressure - I’m a ‘flown’ canary so I may not have all the inside knowledge, but as I understand it Ben Knapper would have a big say in sacking the manager, and that would reflect badly on him having hired Manning in the first place. I mean, if he survived losing to crisis club Derby then a big defeat by Swansea will hardly touch the sides. Incidentally, I think Will Hardly is the next trendy thing lined up to take over…” League Two: Accrington Stanley have a 1-0 lead over Fleetwood Town thanks to an 11th-minute strike from Alex Henderson. League One: Over at Field Mill, Will Evans has given Mansfield a 1-0 advantage over Wigan as we edge closer to half-time. On that note, Watford fan Mac Millings messaged in just a few moments into the early kick-offs. He wrote: “I believe my beloved Hornets have conceded the first goal 7 (SEVEN) games in a row. If they do that against a rampant Coventry side, it could be a long morning for me here in the U.S. Which, of course, means it’s time for my All-Time Breakfast foods XI: Tony Oatmeola Weetabixente Lizarazu Jaap Scram(bled eggs) Cheerios Ferdinand Pedro Porridge Paulo Sousage Bebégel Bebécon Antonin Panencakes Yogerd Müller Kellogg’sechi Iheanacho-coa Puffs Then, after the disastrous opening 10 minutes for the Hornets, he added: “You look away for 5 minutes...” I think it will certainly be a long morning – or afternoon – for any Watford fan… Championship: Coventry have taken an early 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Brandon Thomas-Asante and Jamie Allen in the third and seventh minutes. A nightmare start for Watford. And with, I’m handing over to Emillia Hawkins who will steer you through the afternoon updates. The games at the Coventry Building Society Arena, Portman Road, Fratton Park, Ewood Park, the Toughsheet Community Stadium, Field Mill*, Whaddon Road* and Highbury Stadium are all under way. *Field Mill is technically called the One Call Stadium and Whaddon Road the EV Charger Points Stadium, alas. There are a lot of ‘trendy’ managers in the Championship. Kieran McKenna was once linked with Manchester United and Chelsea, Will Still has a big reputation based on his work in France, Ryan Mason has come from Tottenham and Martí Cifuentes was much vaunted at QPR. Yet it’s Frank Lampard – often derided in his spells as a Premier League head coach – who sits top of the tree. Funny old game. I guess this article could be three words long: “with great difficulty”. Another email that wades into the ‘dinner party’ debate I didn’t even know existed. “Good morning from Geneva,” writes Peter Greenwood. “Having been born and bred in Bury and now living here in Switzerland, I am comfortable with the dualism of ‘dinner’. I thought it was a nice touch to mention it – made matchday live more human somehow. Yet Carbonara is my least favourite Italian sauce.” Last time I helmed the matchday live blog, I provided my predictions for the day’s coming Premier League games. Looking back, I got none of the scorelines correct, but let’s have another go today: Chelsea 3-1 Sunderland Newcastle 2-1 Fulham Man Utd 1-1 Brighton Brentford 2-3 Liverpool Mockery incoming. Norwich fans: is Liam Manning under immense pressure? The Canaries are languishing down in 22nd and defeat at Swansea today could spell big trouble. It seems in the Championship nowadays, judging from those teamsheets, every team must have a Scandinavian goalkeeper, a centre-back called Phillips and at least one player with ‘Thomas’ in their name. Coventry v Watford Coventry: Rushworth; Van Ewijk, Thomas, Kitching; Mason-Clark, Grimes, Allen, Dasilva; Thomas-Asante, Wright, Sakamoto. Watford: Selvik; Ngakia, Abankwah, Keben, Bola; Kayembe, Louza, Sissoko, Vata; Baah, Doumbia. Ipswich v West Brom Ipswich: Walton; Furlong, O’Shea, Kipré, Davis; Matusiwa, J.Taylor, Walle Egeli, Szmodics, Philogene; Hirst. West Brom: Griffiths; Campbell, Phillips, Mepham, C.Taylor; Diakité, Mowatt; Iling-Junior, Price, Johnston; Heggebø. Portsmouth v Stoke Portsmouth: Bursik; Williams, Matthews, Poole, Ogilvie; Yang, Dozzell, Pack, Chaplin; Kirk, Bishop. Stoke: Johansson; Talvoierov, Phillips, Wilmot; Thomas, Pearson, Baker, Cresswell; Manhoef, Bae, Mubama. Some emails! Charles Antaki is delighted to see Danny Welbeck in form: “It warms the cockles to see Welbeck having a moment in the public eye. He’s one of a select few to leave Arsenal for whom the fans still feel affection; there was something instantly likeable about him as a character, and it was understood that he was probably a better player than injuries had allowed him to show. That he can be talked of for a possible England call up six years later is testament to his talent. So it’ll be Arsenal fans who’ll be especially pleased if he scores the winning goal at the World Cup – especially if he’s come on to replace that other guy.” And Mark Hooper steps in to defend me: “Regardless of regional bias, it’s not as if ‘dinner party’ is an unusual concept. There’s even a quite good rock band named after it” Women’s Nations League: A 2-0 defeat to Iceland in Ballymena last night left Northern Ireland with a mountain to climb in their two-legged promotion/relegation playoff. The second leg takes place in Reykjavik on Tuesday. There was a better result for the Republic of Ireland, who beat Belgium 4-2 in their promotion/relegation play-off in Dublin, boosting their hopes of reaching League A. The return leg is on Tuesday, in Leuven. In the Nations League semi-finals, a Klara Bühl strike gave Germany a 1-0 win over France while Alexia Putellas and Clàudia Pina bagged two apiece as Spain hammered Sweden 4-0. Again, the second legs are on Tuesday. Spare a thought for fans of Truro City. They today are making the longest journey for a league match in English football history – a 914-mile round trip to Gateshead away today. “I’ve been at Truro for 10 years now and we’re very, very used to travelling,” club captain Connor Riley-Lowe told the BBC. The players made a 12-hour bus journey to the north east yesterday, which included a stop for a training session at Derby County. Sheffield Wednesday were placed into administration on Friday and given an automatic 12-point deduction by the EFL, which leaves them on minus six points. What a grim season it’s been for the club. However, it seems Dejphon Chansiri’s time as (a very unpopular) owner is now at an end with administrators seeking a new ownership, amid talk of a supporter-led model. The Sheffield Wednesday Supporters’ Trust has ended its boycott of home matches and, ahead of today’s game against Oxford, tweeted: Today’s about backing the lads on the pitch and the people who keep our club going off it. If you’re heading to Hillsborough, please spend what you can inside the ground and at the club shop, it all helps support the staff and the team now. Let’s make some noise and show what Sheffield Wednesday really is - its fans, its players, and its people. Manager Henrik Pedersen said: We have to be Sheffield Wednesday. We have to be a new Sheffield Wednesday with an old heart. We have to keep this understanding because we have a fantastic club, but this fantastic club deserves to grow. Superb comment. Say no more. Here’s another plug for that superb piece on Fishlock’s incredible journey. Are United ‘back’ then? I would advise caution when using that word. There have been false dawns in the past decade or so – many of them. Today’s game versus Brighton represents a different kind of test for Ruben Amorim’s side after the high of their Anfield win. We’ve seen United’s 3-4-3 succeed in a low to mid block against the ‘bigger sides’, with United happy to sit deep and spring forward on the counterattack. Brighton will press, for sure, but they’ll also ask United to play through midfield, with Fabian Hürzeler setting traps to outfox Amorim’s players. Albion have gained a reputation as United’s bogey team in recent years, winning six of their past seven meetings, including convincing 3-1 wins on their past two visits to Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes will make his 300th appearance for Manchester United when he leads them out against Brighton this evening. Is he the club’s best post-Fergie signing? Almost certainly. Fernandes has been chatting to the media this week about his United future, amid those Saudi Pro League links and why the recent signings at Old Trafford are having an impact. The 31-year-old’s family are settled in Manchester and he said “I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still.\\\" “At this club we need to sign big characters,” said Fernandes on the summer additions. “Being a good player is sometimes not enough because of the pressure and attention we get. We brought in players that are aware of the dimensions of the club. “Matheus Cunha has that arrogance to say ‘give me the ball, I want to play, I want to make things’. Have you tried On the ball, the Guardian’s new football game? Give it a go on the ‘Puzzles’ tab of the Guardian app, with a handy guide right here. Real Madrid v Barcelona. Jude Bellingham v Marcus Rashford. First v second in La Liga. Small matter etc etc. Liverpool’s 5-1 midweek shellacking of Eintracht Frankfurt at least put a halt to their run of four straight defeats in all competitions. It was the confidence boost Arne Slot and his players badly needed, but can they now turn around their Premier League form as well? Slot went on the attack in his press conference previewing tonight’s trip to Brentford, standing up for the under-fire and off-colour senior duo of Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah. He dubbed Van Dijk “the most influential captain I’ve had since I have been a manager” and backed Salah – who has not scored in the league since a penalty at Burnley a more than month ago – to “get into those [goalscoring] positions once more. Alexander Isak is a doubt after suffering a groin injury against Frankfurt and Jeremie Frimpong and Alisson are absent. I’m getting some stick in the comments for: a) mentioning my dinner party, and b) using the word ‘meagre’ to describe today’s Premier League fixture list. Four games out of 10 is quite meagre. Fantasy Football Corner: The first thing to say is that you’ve missed the deadline, what with Leeds v West Ham last night. Those pesky Friday night games often catch me out, but alas not this week as I sorted my team amid a spell of Thursday morning boredom. Who will bag points this weekend? You can never bet against Brighton getting among the goals at Old Trafford – Danny Welbeck perhaps? – while Chelsea’s forwards should thrive at home to Sunderland… emphasis there on should. A prominent ‘FPL expert’ was urging everyone to sell João Pedro this week. It’s a trap! It’s a trap! My pick of the week: Marcos Senesi, playing at home to struggling Nottingham Forest. What happened in Europe last night, I hear you ask? Real Sociedad picked up a rare La Liga win, beating Sevilla 2-1; Werder Bremen edged Union Berlin in a mid-table Bundesliga contest; and AC Milan salvaged a last-gasp 2-2 draw with Pisa thanks to Zachary Athekame’s 93rd minute equaliser. Today’s continental offering is far more meaty with Bayern Munich going to Borussia Mönchengladbach in the pick of the German games, plus four La Liga matches including Valencia v Villarreal. The small matter* of El Clásico is tomorrow. Oh and Napoli lock horns with Inter at 5pm (BST) in a game that may prove illuminating re this season’s Serie A title race. *It’s not a small matter, it’s a bloody big football match. For me, dinner can either be lunch or tea. But that’s just me, Manchester-born, Stockport-bred. Last night I made bruschetta and carbonara and called it a dinner party. *Shrugs* This is a really revealing interview with Brentford’s Sepp van den Berg who prepares to face his old side Liverpool tonight and looks back on his difficult time at the Merseyside club: It was definitely dark days. As a 17-year-old boy coming in from a different country, you’re not the priority. I was going home crying at some points and then not speaking to anyone. Do you call this depressed? I think it’s a bit too heavy a word. But I wasn’t feeling well. I wasn’t in the head space you are supposed to be in. I had no confidence and that really affected me as a footballer. I was just constantly doubting myself, like I was not good enough. I didn’t want to go to training, which is not me. Then, you know you are really down low. The Premier League offering may be rather meagre today but there’s some meaty clashes in the EFL – especially in the Championship. Top of the table Coventry can continue their stellar form under Frank Lampard at home to Watford in one of the early games; Ipswich v West Brom is a battle of two underperforming sides who have ambitions to push higher in the table, while Wrexham go to second-placed Middlesbrough looking to inflict just a second defeat of the season on Rob Edwards’ side. In League One, the clash between Stevenage and Bradford is an unlikely second v third scrap – both teams have defied the odds to sit in the promotion race at this stage, although Cardiff can stay top if they win at playoff-chasing Bolton in the early game. I’m picking out Gillingham v Salford as the standout game in League Two. Both teams have been heavily tipped for promotion this season but currently lie in the playoff places after recent dips in form. Who can resurrect their fortunes this afternoon? Aaaaand I’ve probably missed some big games in that short roundup/preview. Comment below or email me with your suggestions … Here’s Sophie Downey writing on the incomparable Fishlock, by the way. Scottish Premiership: Dundee United v St Mirren, Falkirk v Dundee and Livingston v Motherwell are the only three games in the top tier north of the border this afternoon – all 3pm kickoffs – but the story of the season so far (aside from Rangers’ struggles) has been about table-topping Hearts. Here Ewan Murray takes a dive into the surprise success of the Gorgie Boys, who host Celtic on Sunday (midday KO) in the biggest test yet of their title credentials. Welsh legend Jess Fishlock prepares to call time on a glittering international career this afternoon, as they take on Australia in a friendly at her home ground of Cardiff City Stadium. It should be an emotional occasion for the icon of 165 caps, whose Wales career has spanned nearly two decades, with Fishlock telling the BBC she “owes everything to Wales”. “My biggest success so far is having kids say: ‘I can do that’. It was never about me playing. All I want to do is play one more time in front of my family. It’s been the biggest honour to represent Wales.” Whoever thought organising two games to kick off concurrently in Manchester’s two biggest grounds, one at Old Trafford and one at the Etihad, should give their head an almighty wobble. It’s never been known for Manchester United and City to kick off at the same time, so why set that same arrangement for United and England’s Women? A baffling decision, the effects of which will be noticed by anyone and everyone travelling around Manchester today, on trains, tram or road. Rant over. Let’s have a gander at today’s football schedule, then, at least in terms of the big games: 12.30pm – Three Championship games, including Coventry v Watford 3pm – Chelsea v Sunderland &amp; Newcastle v Fulham in the Premier League 3pm – Full EFL and Scottish schedule 5.30pm – Manchester United v Brighton 5.30pm – England Women v Brazil 8pm – Brentford v Liverpool (All times BST – but don’t forget those clocks go back overnight!) Here’s some corking Saturday morning reading for you. Sir Kenny Dalglish talks to Donald McRae about the new film directed by Asif Kapadia which centres on the Scot’s remarkable career in football and his connection with Liverpool. Watching the highlights of Leeds v West Ham (I was conducting a dinner party so missed the full shebang, sorry), I was struck by the ability of Noah Okafor on the wing. He seemed to be involved in everything good Daniel Farke’s side did and looks a cracking signing Farke himself lauded a “win of passion and desire, togetherness and spirit”, while accepting Leeds could have been more dominant on the night. The three points lift the Whites to 13th, with 11 points from their nine games so far, which is a decent launchpad for a realistic tilt at survival. Leeds fans, are you staying up this year? Get in touch! It’s fair to say Nuno has gone from the Nottingham Forest frying pan to a furnace at West Ham. If the Hammers weren’t in trouble before last night’s clash at Leeds, they most certainly are now after a 2-1 defeat at Elland Road left them 19th with just one win this season – which came against Nuno’s Forest when he was still at the City Ground. Brenden Aaronson and Joe Rodon scored early with Mateus Fernandes’s goal coming too late to spark a comeback. “There are many problems in our club unfortunately,” said the Portuguese coach last night. “It is not up to us to hide ourselves behind the problems. Everyone has to be alive and to do much more and be in the right position. “We were not dealing with our defensive situations and I felt like we needed a striker to hold the ball, so maybe that’s not the greatest from me. These kind of mistakes are unacceptable in the Premier League “We don’t expect things to change by themselves. Realising we have time can be a mistake if we don’t change things around quickly.” Good morning and a very happy weekend to you all. Saturday mornings mean our matchday live is up and running and I’ll be steering it until around lunchtime. We’ll have reaction from last night’s games and plenty of buildup to a big weekend in the Premier League, EFL and beyond, with England’s Women taking on Brazil in a big international friendly at the Etihad Stadium later, too. As always with matchday live, we encourage you to drop your comments in below the line, or send us an email with your thoughts and predictions for the weekend to come. I’ll start by plugging our usual ‘10 things to look out for’ before we turn to last night’s Premier League action and some problems already for Nuno Espírito Santo and West Ham United.\",\n                \"author\": \"Emillia Hawkins and Dominic Booth\",\n                \"category\": \"Football\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/25/premier-league-buildup-lionesses-v-brazil-and-more-matchday-live\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6f47606908b536f0de1cb2c6d4154dbc725f1f4/568_286_3478_2783/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T13:32:07+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:37+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 163,\n                \"source\": \"theguardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Leftwinger Catherine Connolly wins Ireland presidential election by landslide\",\n                \"description\": \"Heather Humphreys concedes defeat after early vote tallies show insurmountable gap between candidates\",\n                \"content\": \"The leftwing independent candidate, Catherine Connolly, has won a landslide victory in Ireland’s presidential election. Her rival, Heather Humphreys, conceded defeat on Saturday afternoon after early vote tallies showed an insurmountable gap between the candidates. “Catherine will be a president for all of us and she will be my president and I really would like to wish her all the very, very best,” Humphreys said. Reports from tallymen – unofficial but usually reliable observers at count centres – gave Connolly 64% of the vote after two-thirds of ballots were counted. Connolly 68, captured the imagination of many younger people and was backed by an alliance of leftwing opposition parties in Friday’s election. The presidency is a largely ceremonial office but Connolly’s triumph is a humbling rebuke to the centre-right government. Humphreys, 62, a former cabinet minister who ran for the Fine Gael party, won 29%, according to tallies. Jim Gavin, 54, a candidate for Fianna Fáil who withdrew late from the campaign but whose name remained on the ballot, won 7%. The number of spoiled votes was on track for 13%, a historic high that was seen to reflect widespread frustration with the limited choices. Turnout was estimated to be about 40% of the 3.6 million eligible voters. Speaking after the early tallies, Connolly said she was delighted. “I want to thank everybody, even those that didn’t vote for me. I understand their concerns in relation to who will represent them best.” The tallies showed she beat Humphreys even in Fine Gael strongholds, such as south Dublin. Anger over a housing crisis and the cost of living, campaign blunders by Fine Gael and its ruling partner Fianna Fáil, rare unity among leftwing parties and deft use of social media combined to make Connolly a symbol of change. The prospect of Connolly succeeding President Michael D Higgins and serving a seven-year term at Áras an Uachtaráin, the presidential residence, thrills supporters. She speaks Irish, espouses equality and wishes to ringfence Irish neutrality from what she calls western “militarism”. She has likened Germany’s arms spending to the Nazi era and accused the UK and US of enabling genocide in Gaza. The former clinical psychologist and barrister enthused young people through podcasts and posts that went viral on social media, including videos that showed her doing keepy-uppy. Artists and musicians such as Kneecap and the Mary Wallopers endorsed her. Critics depicted Connolly as a radical who dodged awkward questions and could damage Ireland’s relations with Washington and with its European allies. Irish presidents traditionally played quiet, symbolic roles, but since 1990 Mary Robinson, Mary McAleese and Higgins have turned the office into a more visible platform. Connolly said during the campaign that she would respect the limits of the office, which some interpreted as a tacit promise to rein in controversial views, but analysts predicted friction with the government. She was a marginal political figure when she declared her candidacy in July, and only small parties – the Social Democrats and People Before Profit – backed her. Labour then endorsed her, and Sinn Féin, which had decided to not run its own candidate, threw its formidable resources and electoral organisation behind Connolly. Celebrities such as Bob Geldof, Michael Flatley, Conor McGregor and others had expressed interest in running for president but failed to win the necessary political backing to get on the ballot. Fianna Fáil’s candidate, Gavin, was a political novice who withdrew after a financial scandal imploded his campaign. The late withdrawal meant his name remained on the ballot. Fine Gael’s original candidate, Mairead McGuinness, dropped out, citing health problems, so the party turned to Humphreys. The border county Presbyterian was deemed to have wholesome, mainstream appeal but performed badly in debates.\",\n                \"author\": \"Rory Carroll Ireland correspondent\",\n                \"category\": \"World news\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connolly-ireland-presidential-election-leftwing\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb439e6e444d62baae37915c70c755ef244fe8c3/122_125_1378_1102/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T13:20:40+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:37+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 149,\n                \"source\": \"newsdataio\",\n                \"title\": \"Trump administration won't tap contingency fund to keep food aid flowing, memo says\",\n                \"description\": \"The Trump administration says it won't use a roughly $5 billion contingency fund to keep food aid flowing in November amid the government shutdown.

Because he wants to | Arwa Mahdawi\",\n                \"description\": \"The president’s mega-project raises a lot of questions – including when he’s planning on leaving\",\n                \"content\": \"Donald Trump has quite the passion for American history. If there’s a controversial statue commemorating a dead white supremacist out there, there’s a good chance the president has gone to bat for it. “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” Trump tweeted in 2017, in response to a push to remove Confederate monuments. “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson – who’s next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!” Trump added. Trump is right that you can’t change history. But, if you’re the president, you can abruptly bulldoze it with no permits and no public input. The 123-year-old East Wing of the White House, the home of offices for every first lady for almost half a century, is now a pile of rubble. After Trump said in July that the historic building would not be touched, it was stealthily bulldozed to make way for a $300m ballroom. According to Trump, there was a teeny little change of plans “after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world”. Speaking of plans, the bulldozing went ahead without any such thing being submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government building. But don’t worry, according to the White House, construction plans will be coming soon. Watch this space! While the likes of the National Trust for Historic Preservation are upset about the destruction of a “National Historic Landmark, a National Park, and a globally recognized symbol of our nation’s ideals”, some large corporations appear to be looking on the bright side. Trump has said the new 90,000 sq ft ballroom is going to be “paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”. Now the world’s CEOs have a wonderful opportunity to prove just how friendly to Trump they are. A list of donors including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google have already lined up to contribute to the project. Defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and Palantir – who seem to know a thing or two about reducing beloved buildings to rubble – are also reportedly funding the project. If this sort of thing were happening in a developing country it might smack of corruption. But this is the United States, so it’s obviously all above board. National history aside, this sudden demolition of the first ladies’ headquarters raises a lot of questions. If I lived in a house that I didn’t own – one that I was scheduled to move out of in January 2029 – I probably wouldn’t start an enormous and extremely controversial construction project. Why is Trump doing this? The short answer is: because he wants to. As I think we all know by now, the president does whatever the hell he feels like regardless of norms, conventions, or silly little laws. And, increasingly, there’s nobody there to stop him. The only checks that Trump cares about are the ones made out to him and the only balances he is interested in are those of his bank accounts. Trump has given a few rationales for the project that go beyond ‘because I want to.’ He’s argued that the old East Wing was no longer fit for purpose and a much larger space was needed. There are some people out there who agree with him. Gahl Hodges Burt, for example, who was social secretary for three years under President Ronald Reagan, told the New York Times that tearing down the East Wing to make space for the ballroom was unfortunately necessary and overdue. Beyond practical issues, there’s also ego. Trump’s big boy ballroom will be a big shiny monument to him long after he’s gone. Still, you’ve got to wonder whether this mega-project means the president is not actually planning on going anywhere anytime soon. Particularly since Trump doesn’t seem to be the sort of person to start a large project he won’t have a chance to personally enjoy. The US Constitution’s 22nd amendment makes it very clear that a president cannot have more than two terms. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly teasing the idea that he might serve a third term. In March he told NBC News he was “not joking” about the idea and there were methods for doing so. Trump’s army of sycophants certainly seem to be exploring these methods. Earlier this year Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles proposed amending the Constitution to allow Trump to serve three terms. And this week Trump’s former White House Chief Strategist Steven Bannon told the Economist that the president will “get a third term.” Bannon said that there’s “a plan” to deal with the 22nd amendment and “at the appropriate time” they’ll lay out the plan. It may seem unthinkable that Trump could seek to serve a third term. To quote the president again, however: “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it.” And if there is one lesson to be learned from Maga history, it’s that you should never underestimate Trump or overestimate the institutions that are supposed to keep his megalomania in check. The president will do anything he thinks he can get away with. Google drops a key career resource program for women in tech “The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,” one tech worker told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.” Google can’t be wasting time thinking about equality for women – it’s got Trump’s ballroom to fund!

Japan allows over-the-counter ‘morning after’ pill for first time The emergency contraception is currently available without prescription in more than 90 countries. Sanae Takaichi elected Japan’s first female prime minister Does this mean that she will usher in more egalitarian policies? Unfortunately, it’s looking unlikely. Takaichi cites Margaret Thatcher as an influence and appointed just two women to her 19-member cabinet. She opposes same-sex marriage and is against changes to succession laws that would allow female members of the imperial household to become reigning empresses. Foreign journalists are still not allowed in Gaza The Foreign Press Association (FPA) has said it is disappointed in the Israeli Supreme Court’s decision to grant the State of Israel another delay regarding the independent entry of journalists into Gaza. It’s a shame that more journalists in the Western media aren’t screaming at the top of their lungs about the murder of their colleagues in Gaza and this assault on press freedom – not to mention the fact that Israel is still not allowing adequate aid into Gaza. At the very least the western media should be asking what it is that Israel doesn’t want reporters to see. Evidence of torture, perhaps? Settlers nearly club a Palestinian woman to death The United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs recorded 71 incidents of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property in the occupied West Bank across just one week.

The killer was even given a name: the Rainey Street Ripper. But authorities now say some 36 drownings in the lake, near Rainey Street neighborhood, were probably related to alcohol and drug consumption and the reservoir’s proximity to the city’s famous bar scene. There is almost certainly no serial killer. But will that be enough to put the rumors to bed, or does the broader American fascination – both in fact and in fiction – with macabre mass killers mean that facts and truth have little say in the matter? The report by Texas State University researchers in collaboration with the Austin police department that reviewed 189 cases over a 20-year period found no evidence of a serial murderer, no pattern of clustering or hotspots of similar criminal activity. “While social media speculation has suggested otherwise, the independent academic study supports the findings of APD investigations and confirms that Austin is not facing a serial killer,” the Austin police department said in statement. The study found that men are more likely to drown than women, and that could explain why more men than women were drowning in Lady Bird Lake. Dr Kim Rossmo is professor of criminal justice at the university who developed the field of geographic profiling that helped locate serial killer Robert Pickton, known as the Pig Farmer Killer, in 2001. He told a local news outlet that social media has been “propagating something that’s sensational to get a few more clicks”. “Let’s not spend money and time chasing phantom serial killers,” he added. But the absence of evidence of foul play, and efforts to debunk serial killer theories, may not be enough. Last year, New York police said there was no evidence of a serial killer at work near two nightclubs in Brooklyn, after the bodies of three men were found in a nearby creek over the course of a little over a year. In August, police in Boston addressed online discussions about a potential serial killer in New England after multiple corpses were found across six states since April. The Massachusetts state police have said there is no evidence to suggest a serial killer. Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, author several books on the subject, said: “There is little commonality among the victims.” But the interest in serial killers is scarcely on the wane, despite a striking drop in their numbers since the dark heyday of Ted Bundy, who kidnapped, raped and murdered dozens of young women and girls between 1974 and 1978, and Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed and dismembered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. Fox estimates there has been an 80% drop-off since serial killing peaked in the 1970s. At that time there were nearly 300 known active serial killers in the US. A decade later there were 250 active killers, who accounted for between 120 and 180 deaths a year. In the 2010s, there were fewer than 50 known active killers. Fox points to several factors that might collectively suggest why the numbers have fallen so dramatically. “We have very few hitchhikers now,” he said. “Back then people put them at significant risk when seemingly good Samaritans gave them a ride.” The same can be said for motorists accepting help with a flat tire, leading to a serial killer in Indiana being dubbed “The Flat Tire Killer”. “But now we have Uber, so we don’t to hitchhike, and we have cellphones to call for help. Overall, people are much more aware about strangers.” Equally significant is the adoption of DNA technologies, which did not become available until the 1990s, and the availability of large DNA databanks that can lead to direct identifications or of family members. Idaho mass murderer Bryan Kohberger was identified in part when genetic genealogy pointed to his family in Pennsylvania. Kohberger, while not strictly a serial killer, studied under DeSales university forensic psychology professor Katherine Ramsland. “Advances in DNA technology have given authorities the ability to identify killers before they assemble large body counts,” Fox says, adding that cameras, cross-jurisdiction law enforcement agency communication, and reduced street prostitution have helped to reduce opportunities for serial killers. Thus Kohberger – who killed four students in a single house in Moscow, Idaho – was caught before he could commit a second crime. Fox, who manages the Associated Press/USA Today/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database, also points out that in the 1970s there weren’t so many outlets for sexual sadists to satisfy their urges. “With violent imagery available to all they can to some extent satisfy themselves without having to use an unwilling victim,” he says. But while serial killers fade in reality, there’s a certainly been a surge in interest around serial killers in popular entertainment. Accused Long Island serial killer Rex Heuermann, who faces trial on charges of murdering seven women next year, has already had two documentaries made about his alleged crimes. The Netflix murder series “Monster”, has looked at Dahmer and Ed Gein, the Butcher of Plainfield, who inspired Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. Both shows have been audience hits. “It’s the killers of yesteryear that are entertaining to people,” says Fox. “And that reflects the fact that we have so many. So many, in fact, that two killers in California that were named Freeway Killer One and Freeway Killer Two.” Horrifically, the decline in serial killers has coincided with the rise of something equally horrifying and maybe even more of a threat: mass shooters, especially in schools. “Because of their bizarre and extreme nature, serial killers inspired attention but not necessarily fear, except in a particular community,” Fox argues. “Mass shooting engender fear. So now we have Americans avoiding certain places because they don’t want to get caught up so it’s a different kind of thing.” Still, the societal need to understand the motivation, or lack of it, for murder remains intact. In a new book, The Monsters We Make, published next week, journalist Rachel Corbett threads together her own family’s experience with murder with a study of criminal profiling, a pursuit that’s more art than science. “Society needs monsters,” Corbett writes. “They remind us of who we are – and who we are not. They are terrifying because they break down the boundaries between what we consider human and inhuman, and warn us of what we could become.” The need to create monsters where they may not exist, including the Austin, Massachusetts and Brooklyn scares, confronts a reality identified by Fox that the serial killer era, such as it ever was, has been supplanted. “Even at it’s height the serial killer epidemic it was vastly overblown,” she says. “Now we’re catching old serial killers but the new ones are doing one-off murders here and there.” Corbett point out that the stories do serve a purpose. “A serial killer is Frankenstein - a patchwork for anything you want to project on to it. Conservatives said Ted Bundy was the creation of the loss of religiosity in society, family breakdown and women’s rights. On the left, you had people saying we need advance social programs and understand mental health. Let’s study them and not just kill them.” Regardless of the real world decline of the crime, the American fascination with serial killers lives on.\",\n                \"author\": \"Edward Helmore\",\n                \"category\": \"US news\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/serial-killers-obsession\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c863ceb6b7b8e423d720a65ec292d4d2af0b5f7/752_0_1878_1504/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T13:00:34+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:37+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 166,\n                \"source\": \"theguardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Australia beat South Africa by seven wickets after King’s seven-for: Women’s Cricket World Cup – as it happened\",\n                \"description\": \"<strong>Over-by-over report</strong>: Alana King took an extraordinary seven wickets as Australia finished top of the table and unbeaten \",\n                \"content\": \"Tahlia McGrath’s verdict That was good fun! How good was Kingy? It was pretty awesome – it felt like she’d take a wicket every ball. Super happy for her. It’s awesome to get the job done and walk away with a bit of momentum going into the semi-finals. Laura Wolvaardt’s reaction Definitely not the way we wanted to end the group stages. Kingy bowled excellently – we spoke a lot about facing her and it didn’t quite go to plan. Hopefully in the semi-final we can have one or two players put their hands up. This result means Australia finish top of the table with six wins and a washout from seven games. They will meet India in the second semi-final on Thursday. We thought the pitch might slide on a bit more but I’m happy to extract whatever I can from the wicket. As a bowler you always love wickets to your name but I know I can play different roles for the team. 16.5 overs: Australia 98-3 (Voll 38, Sutherland 10) Annabel Sutherland rushes Australia to victory with a frankly scary 199 balls to spare. They are an outrageously good team, and today Alana King demonstrated her greatness with a record-breaking spell of 7 for 18. 16th over: Australia 87-3 (Voll 37, Sutherland 0) That was the last ball of the over. Wolvaardt isn’t sure whether she’s taken a clean catch at short extra cover to dismiss Beth Mooney. It goes upstairs and the third umpire is satisfied that there are fingers under the ball, so Mooney is on her way for a breezy 42. 15th over: Australia 83-2 (Voll 36, Mooney 39) Mooney clubs Mlaba over mid-off for four. South Africa’s finger-spinners are getting nothing like the turn King managed. With 15 needed to win, it’s time for drinks. 14th over: Australia 76-2 (Voll 35, Mooney 33) South Africa will play England in the first semi-final in Guwahati on Wednesday. The only thing we don’t know is who finishes second in the league stage and will therefore go through in the unlikely event of the semi-final being rained off. 13th over: Australia 73-2 (Voll 35, Mooney 30) Mooney shapes to reverse sweep Mlaba and ends up gloving the ball between the keeper’s legs for four. Voll heaves four more off the last ball to move Australia closer to victory. 12h over: Australia 61-2 (Voll 29, Mooney 24) Four more to Voll, slashes behind square off the new bowler Nadine de Klerk. Australia are romping to victory. 11th over: Australia 55-2 (Voll 24, Mooney 23) The left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba comes into the attack and is reverse swept deftly for four by Voll, who is playing really nicely. This result, incidentally, means Australia will play India at Navi Mumbai in the second semi-final on Thursday. 10th over: Australia 49-2 (Voll 19, Mooney 22) A short ball from Klaas sits up nicely and is pulled effortlessly for four by Mooney. Australia have reached cruising speed, and they’re halfway to their target. 9th over: Australia 43-2 (Voll 19, Mooney 16) Khaka changes ends to replace Kapp. Mooney edges another boundary, then cuffs a more deliberate boundary through the covers. Voll joins in with a classy back-foot drive for four. Australia started slowly but have hit 30 from the last three overs. 8th over: Australia 30-2 (Voll 15, Mooney 7) Mooney edges Klaas wide of slip for her first boundary, then drags a single round the corner to keep strike. Australia need 68 from – yikes – 42 overs to win. 7th over: Australia 24-2 (Voll 15, Mooney 2) Kapp finally concedes her first runs from her 20th delivery when Voll cracks an accomplished drive to the cover boundary. She follows that with a disdainful thump back over the bowler’s head for four more. This is an important little innings for Voll, who would like a score in case she is needed for the semi-finals. 6th over: Australia 13-2 (Voll 7, Mooney 1) South Africa waste a review on an LBW appeal against Voll. You can understand why they’re so excited but that was missing leg by a fair distance. “Yes, there’s plenty about Alana King on Wikipedia, but nowhere does it state that she’s a genius,” says John Starbuck. “That should be remedied.” I thought Wikipedia dealt in cold, hard facts rather than opinions? Oh what a catch! Perry tries to drive the new bowler Masabata Klaas and slices the ball to the left of De Klerk at backward point. She flies through to the air to take a fantastic two-handed catch, possibly the best of the entire World Cup. De Klerk dropped a tough chance to dismiss Voll two overs ago; she’s taken a blinder to get rid of Perry. 5th over: Australia 11-1 (Voll 6, Perry 0) This is an outstanding start from Kapp, who has yet to concede a run after three overs. A maiden to Vill gives her figures of 3-3-0-1. 4th over: Australia 11-1 (Voll 6, Perry 0) Voll is dropped! She slapped Khaka towards backward point, where the leaping De Klerk couldn’t hang on a very tough one-handed chance. She’s shaking her hand in disappointment but it would have been a blinder. 3rd over: Australia 6-1 (Voll 1, Perry 0) A wicket maiden for Kapp. The wicket was her 39th at a World Cup, which puts her second on the all-time list – level with Megan Schutt and Lyn Fullston, four behind Jhulan Goswami. Phoebe Litchfield falls cheaply for the second game in a row. She chased a full, wide delivery from Marizanne Kapp and was smartly caught by Chloe Tryon at slip. 2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Litchfield 5, Voll 1) Litchfield drives Ayabonga Khaka over mid-off for the first boundary of the innings. That’s a fine shot, quite emphatic. An unpleasant story has emerged during this game. Two Australian players were touched inappropriately by a member of the public while walking to a cafe on Thursday; the matter has been reported to the police. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Litchfield 0, Voll 0) Marizanne Kapp, who may or may be internally fuming at the predicament South Africa find themselves in, starts with a very accurate maiden to Phoebe Litchfield. “Good afternoon,” writes John Starbuck. “If Alana King is the definition of ‘genius’ (and I don’t disagree) maybe you should take a leaf out of today’s Guardian Saturday Magazine and enter her career into Wikipedia? A great many cricket followers read it, you know.” Surely she’s already on Wikipedia? Or are you talking chapter and verse, every bowling performance from the age of 12? Thanks Megan, hello everyone. Don’t know about you, but I’m struggling to find words for that Alana King performance: 7-2-18-7, the best figures at a Women’s World Cup and for Australia in women’s ODIs. She’s the dictionary definition of a genius. Well, that’s it from me today – I had a lot of fun guiding you through that record-breaking Alana King performance. I’m handing over to the wonderful Rob Smyth now, who will see you home through Australia’s batting innings. A little snippet of that King brilliance in case you haven’t had the chance to see it yet: Well, what a dominant bowling performance from Australia, led of course by Alana King, who finishes with figures of 7-18. This gives her the best figures in a Women’s World Cup, as well as the best figures by an Australian woman in ODIs, beating Ellyse Perry (7-22) and her coach Shelley Nitschke (7-24). A hugely impressive spell from the legspinner, South Africa just didn’t have any answers for her today. The opening bowlers Schutt and Garth chipped in with a wicket each, and Gardner picked up one late in the innings. South Africa will be incredibly disappointed with their batting. Wolvaardt got them off to a good start, showing intent and seeming to score with ease early on. But when she chipped one to King off Schutt’s bowling with a pretty unnecessary shot, her team struggled to regather themselves. Only Jafta put up a fight after that, with some nice boundary hitting. But the regularity with which King was picking up wickets made it very difficult to create any momentum and in the end, they couldn’t crack the 100 runs. This chase should not be a concern for the Australians, but stranger things have happened! Stay tuned for the next innings to see how they go about it… King gets her seventh wicket and puts an emphatic end to the innings, getting some turn off the pitch and bowling de Klerk. She has been outstanding today. 23rd over: South Africa 95-9 (Mlaba 0, de Klerk 8) de Klerk starts the over with a tickle of an edge that races away past fine leg for four, then gets a single that puts Khaka on strike, which gives Gardner a chance to strike! Mlaba plays a solid defensive shot to finish the over. Gardner gets into the wicket-taking mix, sliding one past the edge of Khaka’s bat and taking out off stump. 22nd over: South Africa 90-8 (Khaka 0, de Klerk 8) King resumes and starts with yet more dots. Her spell has been so inspirational that my 11yo daughter has just decided to switch from pace to legspin while sitting in the loungeroom watching it. de Klerk manages a single from the last ball of the over to keep the strike. 21st over: South Africa 89-8 (Khaka 0, de Klerk 7) Khaka doesn’t take long to face her first ball, with de Klerk rotating the strike early in Gardner’s over. But Khaka can’t do more than play defensively – another tidy over from Gardner with just one run coming from it. 20th over: South Africa 88-8 (Khaka 0, de Klerk 5) Some more King, much to the delight of the crowd, especially the ones with the “I’m just here for Alana King” sign. She delights them even further by taking her sixth wicket to finish the over. You can’t keep King out of this match, Klaas tries to defend, but King goes straight through her and takes out leg stump. 19th over: South Africa 86-7 (Klaas 3, de Klerk 5) Gardner comes back for her second over Klaas pops one up in the air, but it falls safely. She bowls a wide, which is unusual in that it’s the first extra in the match so far. Other than that, it’s a tidy over from her. 18th over: South Africa 82-7 (Klaas 1, de Klerk 4) King continues her spell and Jafta really is built different, because she drives her straight back over her head for four, then gets one just past the slip for another four. But King isn’t willing to let another ball of this “scoring runs” nonsense pass and next ball she has her bowled. Klaas is in to try to stay with de Klerk and see what they can rebuilt. Jafta gets down to try to sweep, but the turn evades her and takes out off stump. 17th over: South Africa 73-6 (Jafta 21, de Klerk 4) Gardner bowls her first over and Jafta starts it very positively, again guiding it between point and gully for a four, followed by a slog over midwicket for another boundary. Gardner fights back with some fuller balls, pushing Jafta back into defensive mode. 16th over: South Africa 64-6 (Jafta 12, de Klerk 4) King continues and almost immediately takes a wicket, then another. She is just getting better with every match. The hat trick ball is the first runs scored against her all match, with de Klerk guiding it down to the boundary to get off the mark. King is on a hat trick – Tryon just chips it straight to Gardner at midwicket and she can’t believe her luck! Dercksen tries to play defensively, but King has her absolutely bamboozled with straight delivery that turns just enough to slide past her bat and take out leg stump. 15th over: South Africa 60-4 (Jafta 12, Dercksen 5) Jafta opens her account with a lovely shot through deep backward point for four, opening the face of the bat and using the speed of the ball to guide it to the boundary. She finds that same gap again a few balls later, just leaning on it and exploiting the gap between point and gully beautifully, before following it up with a boundary on the other side. A great over for Jafta! 14th over: South Africa 48-4 (Jafta 0, Dercksen 5) King continues after a brilliant first over and Dercksen immediately looks uncomfortable. She’s just not quite picking the spin and is struggling to get bat on ball. There’s nearly a run out late in the over when there’s a slight fumble in the field and Dercksen wants to run and is sent back, but Mooney and Voll can’t quite get their act together to hit the stumps before she’s back in her crease. 13th over: South Africa 48-4 (Jafta 0, Dercksen 5) Sutherland continues and there’s an appeal for LBW on the first ball, but the umpire isn’t interested. Dercksen gets her first boundary with a slog past long on. Jafta defends out the over, keen to settle things down after a couple of wickets lost in quick succession. 12th over: South Africa 43-4 (Jafta 0, Dercksen 0) Our first look at spin for the match, with King coming into the attack. She has been sensational so far this World Cup, making it very difficult for the opposition to score against. However Luus thinks she’s built different and almost immediately goes after King and loses her wicket, bringing Kapp to the crease. Kapp hits one back to her, but unfortunately she is the shortest player on the team and it flies over her head. But she doesn’t last much longer, edging one to Garth next ball. Oh dear, things are not going well for South Africa now. Kapp edges one to Garth and she’s gone for a duck. Luus tries to attack King early and only succeeds in top edging it straight up in the air, into the safe, waiting hands of Sutherland. 11th over: South Africa 43-2 (Luus 6, Dercksen 0) Sutherland comes on for her first over of the match, replacing Schutt. Luus turns the strike over early, but Dercksen has a little more trouble, only able to get the ball to the fielders and unable to rotate the strike. 10th over: South Africa 42-2 (Luus 5, Dercksen 0) Garth continues her spell and gets a breakthrough on her second ball, with Brits not able to find her way out of her early troubles and forced to depart for just six. Dercksen takes a little while to get her eye in, seeming to have some difficulty picking the length that Garth is bowling at. It’s a wicket maiden for Garth. Brits gets down attempting to sweep, but the ball hits her in the sternum, which to be fair is an odd way to get out leg before wicket. She reviews, but the decision is upheld. 9th over: South Africa 42-1 (Luus 5, Brits 6) Schutt continues her miserly ways bowling very good line and length and finishing up with another maiden. 8th over: South Africa 42-1 (Luus 5, Brits 6) Brits finally gets her second run off the first ball of Garth’s over, driving to deep backward point and scurrying through. There’s a bit of rain falling at the moment, let’s hope that gets right out of here very soon before it forces us off the field. Brits also gets her first boundary late in the over, with a flick past deep midwicket. 7th over: South Africa 36-1 (Luus 4, Brits 1) Another over from Schutt and she picks up where she left off, with good line and length, forcing Wolvaardt to play defensively. After a few dots, Wolvaardt gets a little frustrated and chips one up to King, bringing Luus out to bat, starting with a streaky edge through Mooney’s legs to get off the mark with a four. A fantastic diving catch from King at short midwicket and Wolvaardt has to go. 6th over: South Africa 32-0 (Wolvaardt 31, Brits 1) Garth continues and Wolvaardt defends the first ball back to her. But then she finds a ball she likes, beating a diving Georgia Voll at backward point for four. Then she edges another one that looks almost catchable, but it flies over Voll’s head for another four. Garth tidies up her length a little and stops the flow of boundaries for the time being. 5th over: South Africa 23-0 (Wolvaardt 22, Brits 1) Wolvaardt back on strike to Schutt and she starts with another glorious cover drive, but this one is just a single. Brits is starting to look a little frustrated at her inability to find runs. She’s getting plenty of bat on ball, but she can’t pierce the infield. A good recovery from Schutt after her last over, just one run from this one. 4th over: South Africa 22-0 (Wolvaardt 21, Brits 1) A muted appeal for LBW midway through Garth’s second over, but it’s more wishful thinking than anything else. Brits hasn’t had much strike so far this match and she’s finding Garth’s length a little uncomfortable at the moment. After that huge last over, it’s a maiden this over – swings and roundabouts. 3rd over: South Africa 22-0 (Wolvaardt 21, Brits 1) Another over from Schutt and Wolvaardt starts it with a thick inside edge that runs away for four and then follows it up with a square drive for a second consecutive boundary. Schutt fights back with a fuller delivery for a dot, but then Wolvaardt chases after a wider one and gets an under edge under Mooney’s gloves and flying away to the fine leg boundary. A cutter from Schutt gets another dot, but Wolvaardt finishes the over with yet another four. 2nd over: South Africa 6-0 (Wolvaardt 5, Brits 1) No surprises here from captain McGrath, it’s Kim Garth on to open from the other end, as has been the case in most of Australia’s matches. Brits is able to get off the mark immediately, with a drive to deep backward point. Wolvaardt takes more of a liking to Garth’s bowling and plays her trademark beautiful cover drive for the first boundary of the match. Mooney looks to be in a little bit of pain, we’ll keep an eye on that. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Wolvaardt 0, Brits 0) Megan Schutt takes the new ball to open the bowling for Australia and Wolvaardt starts things off safely, with two dot balls gently pushed to short midwicket, before defending one back to Schutt. She then goes for a big pull shot, but it’s straight to Perry at midwicket and she can manage a run from it. A maiden to start for Schutt! The teams are out on the field for anthems now – not long to go before the first ball. If you’d like to keep an eye on the men’s ODI between Australia and India in another tab, we’ve got you covered there – check out our OBO here: Just one change to the Australian line up from that win over England, with Georgia Wareham coming in for Sophie Molineux – the two have pretty well alternated throughout the tournament, so that’s not unexpected.

McGrath says their decision to bowl was based on it being more difficult to bat under lights. In wider squad-related news, it was announced today that Australian quick Tayla Vlaeminck will miss the WBBL this season with an ongoing shoulder injury. The fast bowler has been in and out of the Australian team with a very long injury list over the years. News from the field is that Georgia Voll is warming up, which most people are taking to mean that she will again play for Healy. The captain reportedly had a light training session yesterday, but it seems like Australia will play it safe with her and give her more time to recover before the semis. While we’re waiting for the toss, why not take some time to review Australia’s match against England from Wednesday, with this insightful match report from Raf Nicholson? Hello and welcome to match 26 of the Women’s World Cup. Today we’ve got the undefeated defending champions Australia taking on South Africa, who had an absolute horror start to the tournament, ending up all out for 69 against England in their first match. But from there, they have rallied and won their next five games, currently sitting in second on the ladder. They haven’t looked convincing in every moment, but they have done what is needed to win. Australia similarly have had some scratchy wins and got very close to dropping a match on a few occasions, but they have always been able to find someone to dig them out of trouble. Even being forced to play without their captain Alyssa Healy in their last match against England did not cause too many problems, thanks to a stunning partnership from Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner. Today’s game is the last pool match for both teams and while both have secured their semi finals positions, there is still plenty to play for. For Australia, going through the pool rounds undefeated will be the aim, while for South Africa, a win over the reigning world champions would boost their confident going into the elimination rounds and wipe all memories of their disastrous beginning. It’s sure to be a fascinating game, so let’s get into it!\",\n                \"author\": \"Megan Maurice (earlier) and Rob Smyth (now)\",\n                \"category\": \"Sport\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/oct/25/womens-cricket-world-cup-australia-v-south-africa-live-updates-scores-results-teams-squads-start-time-holkar-cricket-stadium\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/97e4bc4d3d411308612c5ba5c64fc6b92692636a/453_80_2883_2307/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T12:57:03+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:37+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 167,\n                \"source\": \"theguardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Labour’s new deputy leader Lucy Powell says she wants Starmer to succeed but party must change – as it happened\",\n                \"description\": \"Powell, who was sacked from cabinet in September, says party must be ‘more principled and strategic, less tactical, and strongly guided by our values’\",\n                \"content\": \"This live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading the updates. You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK and Ireland politics coverage here and here. Here is a summary from today’s blog: Lucy Powell has won Labour’s deputy leadership election, beating her rival Bridget Phillipson, as she said the party would not win by trying to “out-Reform Reform”. Powell, who was the Commons leader until she was sacked in Keir Starmer’s reshuffle at the start of September, was seen as the favourite throughout the contest. She won 87,407 votes, 54% of those cast, while Phillipson received 73,536. Turnout of eligible voters was 16.6%. Her election as deputy leader marks the fourth time the Labour party has elected a woman to this position, after Margaret Beckett, Harriet Harman, and Angela Rayner. The result was announced on Saturday morning after a vote that was widely seen as a referendum for Labour members on the direction of the party under Starmer. Phillipson, the education secretary, was seen as Downing Street’s preferred candidate. Powell has insisted she wants to “help Keir [Starmer] and our government to succeed” but the party “must change how we are doing things to turn things around”. Speaking after the Labour deputy leadership results were announced, Powell said the party had to give a stronger sense of its purpose, values and beliefs. Powell also said “that for too long, the country and the economy has worked in the interests of the few, not the many”. The Manchester Central MP said: “Because let’s be honest, we’ve let Farage and his ilk run away with it.” She also said Labour has to “offer hope” and “the big change the country is crying out for”. Powell described the desire for change as “palpable”. Labour “must unite” said prime minister Keir Starmer after Powell was elected Labour’s new deputy leader. In his speech, he admitted that the past week, a bruising one for the party, had shown the urgency of the task. He added: “Renewal is the only answer to decline, to grievance and to division and we have to keep going on that.” Starmer described the new deputy Labour leader as “a proud defender of Labour values”. The prime minister also touched upon British values and said the Labour party needs to come together to defend them as the party are “facing opponents who want to wage war against all that”. At an event in Southwark in London after the official election result announcement, Powell said it was Labour’s job to stand together and see off “division, hate, disillusionment [and] “discontentment”. Powell told activists and Labour party supporters that she was “absolutely thrilled” to have been elected as the party’s new deputy leader. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said she would continue to be a “strong voice” at the cabinet table despite losing out to Powell in the deputy leadership contest. She said it was “crucial” for the party to “come together to take the fight to Reform in next year’s crucial Senedd, Holyrood and local elections”. Former deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, congratulated Powell on her victory, describing her as “a powerful voice for our movement, our Labour party values, and the change the country needs”. The contest was triggered by Rayner’s resignation after she failed to pay the correct stamp duty on a property purchase. “The country doesn’t have time for internal party feuds,” said Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper in comments responding to the news that Powell had been elected deputy leader of the Labour party. “Powell’s election is a sign of the disillusionment of Labour members – but there is a much much bigger and more worrying sign. Turn out was just 16%”, wrote the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot, as she shared her reaction to Powell being elected as Labour’s new deputy leader. Starmer and justice secretary David Lammy should take responsibility for the error which led to a former asylum seeker, who sexually assaulted a woman and a teenage girl, to be accidentally released from prison, Epping Forest’s Tory MP said on Saturday. Epping Forest MP Neil Hudson told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “This sounds like an operational error, but the buck has to stop somewhere, and it has to stop at the top, at the justice secretary, the home secretary and the prime minister.” The influential Labour thinktank the Fabian Society is urging Rachel Reeves to raise £12bn in next month’s budget by extending the freeze on income tax thresholds for another two years. Joe Dromey, the Fabians’ general secretary, argues in a new report that the move is the “best available option” for the chancellor as she seeks to offset the impact of weaker economic forecasts in her 26 November statement. The leftwing independent Catherine Connolly is on track to win Ireland’s presidential election, according to early vote tallies. Reports from tallymen – unofficial but usually reliable observers at count centres – gave Connolly a wide lead on Saturday soon after ballot boxes were opened at 9am. Health secretary Wes Streeting has warned people not to buy weight loss jabs from unregulated sources after an illegal laboratory was dismantled. Officers from the Criminal Enforcement Unit (CEU) of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) raided the factory in Northampton and seized unlicensed medication worth £250,000. Deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell said she had “stood firm” with victims of grooming gangs and wanted the promised inquiry established as soon as possible, reports the PA news agency. Powell was forced to apologise in May after appearing to dismiss concerns about grooming gangs as a “dog whistle” issue. Asked about her comments after her deputy leadership election victory, she told broadcasters: I’m absolutely determined, I always have been, to make sure that those that were perpetrating grooming against vulnerable young girls and women they are found, they are charged, they are brought to justice, and all of those who turned a blind eye are also held to account for what they did. I’ve stood firm with those victims throughout my career and I continue to do so today and I hope we get the inquiry up and running as soon as possible. During a debate on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions in May, Reform UK supporter Tim Montgomerie asked Powell if she had seen a recent Channel 4 documentary on grooming gangs. Powell responded “oh, we want to blow that little trumpet now do we” and “let’s get that dog whistle out shall we”. She subsequently said she was “challenging the political point scoring around it, not the issue itself” and was “sorry if this was unclear”. Labour’s new deputy leader Lucy Powell said the error which saw Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu released was a “big mistake”. Former asylum seeker Kebatu was jailed for 12 months in September for sexual assault and made the subject of a five-year sexual harm prevention order, but on Friday was released from prison in error. Powell told broadcasters: This is an operational matter and I’m sure the Ministry of Justice will be making their comments on that soon. But obviously it’s a big mistake and we need to find him quickly and make sure that he’s deported, and that’s what we’ll be determined to do. Health secretary Wes Streeting has warned people not to buy weight loss jabs from unregulated sources after an illegal laboratory was dismantled, reports the PA news agency. Officers from the Criminal Enforcement Unit (CEU) of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) raided the factory in Northampton and seized unlicensed medication worth £250,000. An MHRA spokesperson said: This is the first illicit production facility for weight loss medicine discovered in the UK and is believed to be the largest single seizure of trafficked weight loss medicines ever recorded by a law enforcement agency worldwide. During the search, MHRA officers, supported by Northamptonshire police, seized tens of thousands of empty weight loss pens ready to be filled, raw chemical ingredients and more than 2,000 unlicensed retatrutide and tirzepatide pens awaiting dispatch to customers. The street value of the finished weight loss products alone is estimated to be more than a quarter of a million pounds. The officers also found “sophisticated packaging and manufacturing equipment” as well as £20,000 in cash. Streeting said: This is a victory in the fight against the shameless criminals who are putting lives at risk by peddling dangerous and illegal weight loss jabs to make a quick buck. These unregulated products, made with no regard for safety or quality, posed a major risk to unwitting customers. My message is clear: don’t buy weight loss medications from unregulated sources. Talk to your GP, seek NHS advice, and don’t line the pockets of criminals who don’t care about your health. Safe, appropriate, licensed obesity drugs can greatly benefit those in need if taken under medical supervision, and I urge people to only purchase and use them with the approval and oversight of medics and pharmacists. Andy Morling, head of the MHRA’s criminal enforcement unit, said: This seizure shows the lengths these criminals will go to for profit. People should be extremely cautious when buying medicines online. Prescription medicines should only be obtained from a registered pharmacy against a prescription issued by a healthcare professional. Taking prescription medicines sourced in any other way carries serious risks to your health – there are no guarantees about what they contain, and some may even be contaminated with toxic substances. Taking out the first illicit weight loss medicine manufacturing facility found in the UK is a landmark result for the MHRA and a major blow to the illegal trade. These products are untested, unauthorised and potentially deadly. By taking this organised criminal network out of operation and stopping tens of thousands of potentially fatal products from entering circulation, we’ve prevented a serious risk to public health. This is an illicit global market that endangers patients, puts big money in the pockets of organised criminals, and undermines legitimate healthcare. This operation demonstrates, once again, that my officers will stop at nothing to identify, disrupt and dismantle the organised criminal networks who put profit before safety. The influential Labour thinktank the Fabian Society is urging Rachel Reeves to raise £12bn in next month’s budget by extending the freeze on income tax thresholds for another two years. Joe Dromey, the Fabians’ general secretary, argues in a new report that the move is the “best available option” for the chancellor as she seeks to offset the impact of weaker economic forecasts in her 26 November statement. Reeves is expected to have to find £10bn to £30bn in annual tax increases or spending cuts to remain on track to meet her fiscal rules, after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) downgraded its projections for growth. Dromey describes extending the threshold freeze as “an effective and progressive way to raise over half the funding that she needs, with most coming from wealthier households, and with relatively little political risk”. Starting in 2022 as the UK recovered from the costs of the Covid pandemic, Rishi Sunak froze the thresholds at which workers move into a higher income tax band instead of increasing them each year in line with inflation. Jeremy Hunt as chancellor extended that pause but it is set to end in 2027/28. Over that time, the OBR estimates that the freeze will have brought in an additional £45bn a year. Extending it could be controversial as the number of people paying the 40% higher rate of income tax, which currently kicks in at £50,271, is already set to expand significantly. Dromey acknowledges the downsides of the policy, including the fact opposition parties are likely to highlight Reeves’s argument in last year’s budget that maintaining the freeze would “hurt working people [and] take more money out of their payslips”. But he argues it would be the progressive policy choice. “The chancellor recently said she wanted to ensure that those with the ‘broadest shoulders pay their fair share of tax’. Our modelling suggests that half (49%) of the revenue raised would come from the highest-earning fifth of households. Conversely, the poorest fifth of households would bear just 4% of the cost,” he writes. Former deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, has congratulated Lucy Powell on her victory. In a post on X, Rayner wrote: Delighted for my friend, and brilliant colleague Lucy Powell. She’ll be a powerful voice for our movement, our Labour party values, and the change the country needs. The contest was triggered by Rayner’s resignation after she failed to pay the correct stamp duty on a property purchase. The leftwing independent Catherine Connolly is on track to win Ireland’s presidential election, according to early vote tallies. Reports from tallymen – unofficial but usually reliable observers at count centres – gave Connolly a wide lead on Saturday soon after ballot boxes were opened at 9am. Opinion polls had predicted a landslide for Connolly, 68, who captured the imagination of many younger people and was backed by an alliance of leftwing opposition parties in Friday’s election. The presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but victory for Connolly, a member of parliament from Galway, would be a humbling rebuke to the centre-right government. Her opponent, Heather Humphreys, 62, a former cabinet minister who ran for the Fine Gael party, was tainted by association with the unpopular ruling coalition. Anger over a housing crisis and the cost of living, campaign blunders by Fine Gael and its ruling partner Fianna Fáil, rare unity among leftwing parties and deft use of social media combined to make Connolly a symbol of change. Early tallies from Clare, Dublin, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Meath and Wexford gave Connolly a clear lead, in some cases beating Humphreys by a ratio of two-to-one. The result “looks incredibly positive” for Connolly, said Labour leader Ivana Bacik. There were also indications of a low turnout and unusually high number of spoilt votes, reflecting widespread frustration at the choice on offer and lack of additional candidates on the ballot. Powell added: The country hasn’t worked for people for the last 14 years and we’re going about fixing that every single day. And I wanted to be here in London today, because we’ve got these huge elections next May here in London, in Scotland, in Wales and right across the country, and I’m going to get to work today, from day one to make sure that we get these brilliant candidates [and] these brilliant councillors elected here in London so that they can continue to deliver that change here on the ground in London and right across the country. Because, it’s [by] having Labour councillors, Labour MSPs, Labour Senate members, Labour representatives right round the country working with the Labour government that we can bring that transformational change that we promised people at the election [and] that I’m determined that we deliver. So, thank you all very much for coming today. Lucy Powell has told activists and Labour party supporters that she is “absolutely thrilled” to have been elected as the party’s new deputy leader. At an event in Southwark in London, Powell said: It really rests on our shoulders now as the Labour party [and] as the Labour government to prove that progressive, mainstream politics can really change people’s lives for the better, because we are facing these forces of division, of hate, of disillusionment, of discontentment. And it’s our job to really see that off and stand together and to stand tall in the face of that division and that hate, and that is what I will do working alongside Keir [Starmer], Anna [Turley], the rest of the party and the Labour government, because I want to show people what this Labour government is really about. We are about changing people’s lives for the better. Newly elected deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell is to meet activists and party supporters in London alongside Labour party chair, Anna Turley. You can follow along with the live stream now in the video below: The Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot, has shared her reaction to Lucy Powell being elected as Labour’s new deputy leader: Powell’s election is a sign of the disillusionment of Labour members – but there is a much much bigger and more worrying sign. Turn out was just 16%. This is likely to be the case because a large number trade union levy payers – who also get a vote – are unlikely to have turned out to vote. Labour’s new deputy leader Lucy Powell said the party had to give a stronger sense of its purpose, values and beliefs. Powell won the deputy leadership contest with 54% of the vote, beating Bridget Phillipson, who took a 46% share. You can listen to Powell’s speech from earlier in the video below: Here are some images coming in via the newswires from this morning: Responding to the news that Lucy Powell has been elected deputy leader of the Labour party, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: The fact that media were not allowed in to this announcement says it all. Labour just doesn’t listen. People are feeling frustrated and disappointed that the government has failed to deliver the change they promised, after years of Conservative chaos and neglect. We need to see far more urgency and ambition. Instead of punishing policies like the jobs tax and family farm tax, we need a much bolder plan for growth and the cost of living, for repairing our relationship with Europe and for fixing the NHS and care. That must be Labour’s focus. The country doesn’t have any time for internal party factions or feuds. Lucy Powell, who was the Commons leader until she was sacked in Keir Starmer’s reshuffle at the start of September, was seen as the favourite throughout Labour’s deputy leadership contest. The result was announced on Saturday morning after a vote that was widely seen as a referendum for Labour members on the direction of the party under Starmer. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, was seen as Downing Street’s preferred candidate. Both candidates called for the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap, a policy that caused a parliamentary rebellion within weeks of Labour taking office and is largely unpopular with members. The contest grew increasingly fractious over the last six weeks. Last weekend, Powell was described as “the Momentum candidate” and Phillipson gave an interview saying her rival would cost the party the election. The vote was called after Angela Rayner resigned last month when she was found to have underpaid stamp duty on a house purchase in Brighton. Unlike Rayner, Powell will not become deputy prime minister, with the position having already been given to David Lammy. The result reflected polling which had suggested the MP for Manchester Central had a healthy lead as voting closed on Thursday. She is seen as being closely associated with the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, who was accused of launching a leadership bid in all but name before the party’s conference last month. During the campaign, Powell frequently referred to “mistakes” made by the party on issues such as the winter fuel allowance. In a final message to supporters this week she appeared to criticise a “command and control” culture within government, arguing that “blindly following along” was “a dereliction of our duty to defeat the politics of hate and division”. The Guardian’s political editor, Pippa Crerar, says that Lucy Powell’s election as Labour’s new deputy leader will be “widely interpreted as a sign of disillusionment among party members, after she pledged to be their voice to leadership”. Crerar also highlighted the low turnout of 16.6%. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said she would continue to be a “strong voice” at the cabinet table despite losing out to Lucy Powell in the deputy leadership contest. Phillipson said: I want to congratulate Lucy on her victory in this contest. It’s crucial that our party now comes together to take the fight to Reform in next year’s crucial Senedd, Holyrood and local elections. I am obviously disappointed at today’s result but I’m proud of the campaign I’ve run. I want to thank everyone who voted for me in this contest. I feel privileged to have had the chance of meeting members across the country, talking about their priorities and what they want to see: a united party, talking about the good things this Labour government is doing, not fixating on our mistakes. Regardless of today’s result, I will always be a strong voice for our members and trade unions at the cabinet table and I will still be that powerful campaigning presence at the top of government working to deliver a crucial second term of Labour government. The election of Lucy Powell as Labour deputy leader follows a bruising few days for Keir Starmer after the chaos in the grooming gangs inquiry, the return of a small boat migrant who was sent to France under the one in, one out deal, the error which saw Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu released from prison, and defeat for Labour in its Welsh stronghold of Caerphilly, reports the PA news agency. Starmer said: We must press ahead with the renewal that working people need to see. Now, this week, we received another reminder of just how urgent that task is. A bad result in Wales, I accept that, but a reminder that people need to look out their window and see change and renewal in their community, opportunities for their children, public services rebuilt, the cost of living crisis tackled. Renewal is the only answer to decline, to grievance and to division and we have to keep going on that. It is the offer we must make to the people of Scotland, Wales and England next year. And that means we must come together. We must unite. We must keep our focus on what is, in my view, the defining battle for the soul of our nation. Lucy Powell said Labour “won’t win by trying to out-Reform Reform” after being elected as the party’s new deputy leader. Speaking after the results of the deputy leadership were announced, Powell said: It starts with us wrestling back the political megaphone and setting the agenda more strongly. Because let’s be honest, we’ve let Farage and his ilk run away with it. He wants to blame immigration for all the country’s problems. We reject that. Our diagnosis is different: that for too long, the country and the economy has worked in the interests of the few, not the many. The Manchester Central MP added: We won’t win by trying to out-Reform Reform, but by building a broad progressive consensus. As mentioned below, Keir Starmer described the new deputy Labour leader, Lucy Powell, as “a proud defender of Labour values”. The prime minister also touched upon British values and said the Labour party needs to come together to defend them. He added: We’re facing opponents who want to wage war against all that. Here is a breakdown of the results: Lucy Powell received 87,407 votes from the Labour party membership and affiliates. Bridget Phillipson received 73,536 votes. The number of eligible voters was 970,642 and a total of 160,993 votes were cast, resulting in a turnout of 16.6%. Powell was first elected as the MP for Manchester Central in a byelection in 2012. Her election as deputy leader marks the fourth time the Labour party has elected a woman to this position, after Margaret Beckett, Harriet Harman, and Angela Rayner. Labour’s new deputy leader Lucy Powell said the party had to give a “stronger sense of our purpose” and our “values and beliefs”. Powell won the Labour deputy leadership contest with 54% of the vote, beating Bridget Phillipson who took a 46% share. The new deputy leader said: We have to offer hope, to offer the big change the country is crying out for. We must give a stronger sense of our purpose, whose side we are on and of our Labour values and beliefs. She said that “people feel that this government is not being bold enough in delivering the kind of change we promised”. Lucy Powell was sacked from Keir Starmer’s cabinet in September and has indicated she will refuse a return to a government role so she can speak more openly about the direction of the party in office. She has insisted she wants to “help Keir and our government to succeed” but the party “must change how we are doing things to turn things around”. In a final message to supporters earlier this week she said Labour had to be “more in touch with our movement, and the communities and workplaces we represent, more principled and strategic, less tactical, and strongly guided by our values”. Lucy Powell has paid tribute to former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner, saying she has some “big shoes to fill”, as she took to the stage to celebrate her win. Powell spoke about how “division and hate” has increased. She said the desire for change is “palpable”. After her speech, Keir Starmer said he was “delighted” to work with Powell and they would get started straight away. He described Powell as having “always been a proud defender of Labour values”. Home secretary Shabana Mahmood, the chair of Labour’s National Executive Committee, has announced the results of the Labour deputy leader contest, naming Lucy Powell as the winner. Powell received 87,407 votes, while Bridget Phillipson got 73,536 votes. The turnout was 16.6%. You can follow the announcement of Labour’s new deputy leader and speeches via the live stream in the video below: Keir Starmer, Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson have now all arrived at the venue where the result of the deputy leadership contest will be announced. The result of the contest is expected to be announced at 10am and will be followed by a speech from the winner. Starmer will also speak after. Inside No 10, there is disquiet among some strategists about Lucy Powell as deputy leader. Relations with Keir Starmer’s team were particularly frosty over the welfare vote. Powell was a key figure in the cabinet underlining the possibility that the government could lose the vote – and the first to tip off No 10 about the possibility of a reasoned amendment to kill the bill. Some of Starmer’s team then suggested they believed she was in cahoots with some of the welfare rebels, which was fiercely denied. Trust was never regained – Powell was furious that her information led to her being cast as disloyal. But a source close to Powell said she intended to be as collegiate as possible – and said she would expect to attend political cabinet, warning there would dire consequences if there was any attempt to ban her. They said Powell had declined numerous media offers to make explicit criticism of government mistakes. Being the only candidate with the ability to influence cabinet decisions, Bridget Phillipson has made a number of firm commitments to members. She will sit on the future of work committee that oversees the workers’ rights legislation – promising she will veto any attempt to water down or slow the proposals. She said she would formally seek members’ and trade unionists’ views each quarter and report them directly back to the cabinet. And she has argued she has the credentials to fight Reform, in a north-east seat that looks at risk in the next election. There is no love lost between the two candidates, especially as the race has gone on. Powell is irritated at being seen as the proxy candidate for the leadership ambitions of Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester. But there is a fear among Starmer allies that should Burnham seek to return to Westminster as an MP, blocking his candidacy would be harder with Powell as deputy leader, as she would sit on the national executive committee, which oversees selections. There will be no big event to mark the new deputy leader result on Saturday, just a camera in Labour HQ with the results and a short speech from the winner. Some of Lucy Powell’s backers are irritated by the low-key plan. There are fears that she may be in effect frozen out – and uncertainty over whether she would be able to do her own broadcast rounds or election organising. “They need to respect the mandate if she wins,” one ally said. Senior strategists had hoped five weeks ago to avoid a contest altogether, with a high threshold for MP nominations. Keir Starmer made appointments in the reshuffle for the party chair and the deputy prime minister, crowding out the role of deputy leader. But with a restive parliamentary party a fix looked unlikely even though some ministers and aides piled pressure on MPs to back Bridget Phillipson. After the first polls dropped, amid the turmoil over the departure of both Angela Rayner and Peter Mandelson, Powell looked unassailable with a 17-point lead. But the race has a number of unknowns. Phillipson’s team have made a number of strong policy interventions including on child poverty. Low turnout is expected from an apathetic party membership. And Phillipson, who has close union relations, has gained the endorsements of three major trade unions that have a vote in the deputy leadership – and which have never been polled. She has more endorsements in London – with a higher membership – and will also be likely to command loyalty in the north-east, which also has high membership numbers. But even with all of those caveats, most Labour MPs believe Powell will win. The leadership race has pushed both to be more publicly radical. Powell has pushed for an end to factionalism and a louder assault on Nigel Farage and the politics of division, warning about the voters being lost on the party’s left flank. She also made an early call for the end of the two-child benefit limit – a tank on Phillipson’s lawn. Phillipson has made concrete policy commitments, which hold more weight as a cabinet minister, saying she will work to end to the two-child limit and will be the bulwark in government against the watering down of Labour’s workers’ rights package. “The stakes are, on the surface, incredibly low,” one MP said. “But it has the potential to have huge consequences if Lucy wins. But for a hell of a lot of my members, believe it or not, they aren’t even that engaged.” Prime minister Keir Starmer and justice secretary David Lammy should take responsibility for the error which led to a former asylum seeker who sexually assaulted a woman and a teenage girl to be accidentally released from prison, Epping Forest’s Tory MP said on Saturday. Ethiopian asylum seeker Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, was jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, a crime which triggered protests at the Bell hotel in Epping where he had been staying. Epping Forest MP Neil Hudson told BBC Radio 4’s Today: This sounds like an operational error, but the buck has to stop somewhere, and it has to stop at the top, at the justice secretary, the home secretary and the prime minister. They have said that they are livid and appalled. Well, quite right, they should be livid and appalled. But that’s that’s not good enough, and the Labour government needs to get a grip of this issue. They need to apprehend this man, but they’ve got to sort this issue out, and that’s what my constituents, who are deeply distressed and upset are saying. In case you missed it, in this previously published piece from the Guardian Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell answered reader questions on wealth taxes, Brexit, the climate crisis and the far right: Here is today’s politics agenda, according to the PA news agency’s schedule: 10am: Labour’s new deputy leader will be announced in central London. Speeches are expected afterwards from the winner of the contest and from the prime minister. 1pm: Protesters from opposing groups are expected to descend on different sides of London after police banned Ukip supporters from gathering in Whitechapel, an area of the capital with a large Muslim population, because of what officers called a “realistic prospect of serious disorder”. Ukip supporters are expected to gather in west London at 1pm. Saturday: Counting is to begin today to reveal who the Irish public have voted to be their next president. Epping Forest MP Neil Hudson is on the morning media rounds for the Conservatives. Labour’s new deputy leader will be announced today, with polling suggesting Lucy Powell enjoyed a healthy lead over education secretary Bridget Phillipson as voting closed on Thursday, reports the PA news agency. During the campaign, Powell frequently referred to “mistakes” made by the party on issues such as the winter fuel allowance. And in a final message to supporters this week the Manchester Central MP appeared to criticise a “command and control” culture within government, arguing that “blindly following along” was “a dereliction of our duty to defeat the politics of hate and division”. If Powell does emerge victorious, the result is likely to be seen as a rebuke to Keir Starmer’s leadership from Labour members, more than half of whom now believe the party is heading in the wrong direction, reports the PA news agency. The prime minister has already endured a difficult week, dominated by a row over the grooming gangs inquiry and capped with defeat in a Senedd byelection in Caerphilly, a seat held by Labour for a century. Labour’s struggles in the polls have already led to some questions among backbenchers about Starmer’s leadership of the party. Powell has stressed that she wants to “help Keir and our government to succeed” but also told supporters the party “must change how we are doing things to turn things around”. Meanwhile, Phillipson, seen as No 10’s preferred candidate for the deputy leadership, has stressed unity, warning that voting for her opponent would result in “internal debate and divisions that leads us back to opposition”. The result of the deputy leadership election is expected to be announced on Saturday at 10am BST. I’ll bring you updates on the results and reaction as they come in. Here are some other headlines from UK politics: Cutting the annual cash Isa allowance will not encourage many savers to switch to shares but could push up mortgage costs, MPs have warned the chancellor. Earlier this year, Rachel Reeves paused plans to limit the cash Isa allowance but in the run-up to next month’s budget there has been renewed speculation that it could be reduced to £10,000 in an attempt to promote growth. A wipeout for Labour in next May’s local elections would spell the end of Keir Starmer’s premiership, MPs have said, after the party suffered a crushing defeat in its traditional heartland in Wales. Though Plaid Cymru beat Reform UK to capture the Senedd seat in Caerphilly, the result highlighted a striking collapse of Labour’s vote, prompting fears in Westminster that Labour could be reduced to third place in Wales, a loss that would leave the leader’s position unrecoverable. Rishi Sunak was the only politician to be sent a witness statement by the deputy national security adviser at the centre of a controversy about the collapse of a case against two British men accused of spying for China. According to letters sent to the joint committee on the national security strategy, the statement from Matthew Collins in December 2023, which was sent to the then prime minister and his advisers, did not describe China as an enemy, another key element of the case.\",\n                \"author\": \"Amy Sedghi\",\n                \"category\": \"Politics\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/25/new-labour-deputy-leader-lucy-powell-bridget-phillipson-uk-politics-latest-news-updates\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6c1c78348a84ad42827bd42728ead245493b037/412_0_4120_3296/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T12:30:25+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:38+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 168,\n                \"source\": \"theguardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Suicides linked to domestic abuse should be investigated as potential homicides, say UK families\",\n                \"description\": \"Landmark meeting in Westminster hears from string of relatives who say they have been failed by justice system\",\n                \"content\": \"Every suicide in which the deceased has been a victim of domestic violence should be investigated as a potential homicide, according to calls by campaigners who want see abusers held to account for the devastating affect of their actions. The move is necessary because police and prosecutors are not doing enough to bring perpetrators to justice in cases of suicide after domestic abuse. “In case after case, there is systemic and structural failure, especially within the criminal justice system, to scrutinise these deaths with the seriousness that they deserve,” Pragna Patel, co-director of the campaign group Project Resist said, at a landmark meeting in Westminster earlier this week. The meeting, organised by Project Resist, which runs a “Suicide is Homicide” campaign to fight for change in the criminal justice system, brought together families who had lost loved ones to suicide after domestic abuse. Sharon Holland lost her daughter Chloe Holland, 23, in March 2023. Before her death, Chloe had reported her former partner, Marc Masterton to police, giving a two-hour video interview as evidence against him. After her death, Masterton was convicted of coercive and controlling behaviour and jailed for 41 months. He was later jailed for three years and seven months after a second woman came forward to report that she had been in a violent and abusive relationship with him. After Chloe’s death, Holland decided to campaign for a new law to bring perpetrators to justice; however she then realised that laws were already in place, they just weren’t often being used to secure prosecutions. “I decided it wasn’t a new law I needed as existing laws were already there, and after finding out how much my daughter had been failed previous to her taking her life by the police and many other agencies, they needed to do their job properly, and things needed to change,” she said. “Over 47 families have found me and only four of us have had a conviction,” she added. “I was so shocked to see so many families who have been fighting the police and CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] for years and getting no justice for their child or sibling and didn’t have a voice and couldn’t speak out in case it affected investigations that weren’t possibly going anywhere.” Saskia Lightburn-Ritchie’s daughter Hannah died on the in May 2017 at the age of 30, in what she described as “the final act of violence” in a campaign of abuse. “[Hannah] was vibrant, she was loving,” she said. “She was full of promise, and she was an amazing, really loving mum to her two children, and she died by suicide after two years in a relationship where she was systematically destroyed by her partner,” she said. “She was physically beaten, she was psychologically tortured, she was controlled and broken down piece by piece until she could not see a way forward. The man who did this to her walked free, because we call it suicide, we close the file and we move on. “But I could not move on,” she said, “and I haven’t been able to move on. In truth, Hannah didn’t just die by suicide. She was killed. She was killed slowly and deliberately over a two year period, and when I went to the police, when I begged them to investigate what he had done to her, I was told that there was nothing that they could do. “There was no investigation into her death. The domestic homicide review, which I had to fight for, took five years and changed nothing. A four day inquest found death by suicide, despite huge evidence over a very traumatic four day period of domestic abuse and failings by multiple services.” Lightburn-Ritchie told the meeting that for eight years she has “been fighting a system that refuses to see what is right in front of it”. She said the suicide is homicide campaign was critical “because when someone dies by suicide after they’ve endured domestic abuse, we have to investigate it for what it really is, which is homicide. “We need to use the legislation we currently have effectively and it really isn’t happening at the moment, and we need to hold abusers accountable for driving their victims to death. “We have the laws. We need the will, we need police to investigate properly. We need the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute. We need judges to understand that words and control can kill just as much as hands and weapons.” At a second meeting in the House of Commons, chaired by Labour MP Kirith Entwistle, and attended by safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, the bereaved relatives again told their stories. Alex Davies-Jones, parliamentary under-secretary of state for victims, told the meeting: “These deaths are often written off as if they were their decision, they chose to do this, when, in truth, these were the culmination of actually, somebody else’s violence, and these aren’t isolated stories.” “Our law is broken, we know that,” she said. “Particularly around homicide, around murder or manslaughter, it is piecemeal. It’s not written in statute anyway, it has been developed with common law practices for centuries, and it is no longer fit for purpose, quite frankly, it’s the world that we currently live in. “I’m not going to pretend that it’s going to be easy to fix. It is incredibly complex and difficult, especially when you look at the issue of homicide, but we recognise that it needs to be looked at.” A CPS spokesperson said: “Domestic abuse is a heinous crime and our prosecutors are actively advised to consider murder and manslaughter charges in suicide cases where there is a known context of domestic abuse or other controlling or coercive behaviour. “We have previously charged a number of defendants for causing the death of a partner they abused, including in proceedings which are currently active. “We are also working with police and other stakeholders to ensure these kinds of offences are well-understood – so that we can bring perpetrators to justice for the full extent of their crimes.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

They feel if they can march through our borough with impunity, they can go anywhere. For them, it’s like Wembley (stadium), it’s the ultimate goal,” said Glyn Robbins, co-founder of United East End, an anti-far right coalition of community organisations. In the East End, the historically working-class neighbourhoods in the shadow of the City of London, there’s a feeling that history is repeating itself. It was 89 years ago this month that local people, many of them British Jews, drove out Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirt militia from Whitechapel in the East End, in what has become known as the Battle of Cable Street. In the decades since, the National Front, the BNP and the English Defence League have all tried to carve out a foothold in the East End. In 2025, communities are fighting back against the hard right yet again. This week, rather than attempting to escort protesters, as they had in Mosley’s day, London’s police stopped the hard right UK Independence Party (Ukip) from staging a “crusade on Whitechapel” in the borough of Tower Hamlets, where 40% of the population is Muslim and 14% were born in the EU. The Metropolitan police said the ban was to prevent “serious disorder.” It comes weeks after Tower Hamlets council passed a motion that said flags were “important emblems of patriotism and pride”, but condemned “outside far-right agitators … attempting to import division into our borough,” particularly on the Isle of Dogs, where the far-right BNP won a council seat back in 1993. Furious far-right influencer Tommy Robinson tweeted the photographs of nine British Muslim councillors to his 1.7 million followers, saying: “Here’s a list of the names and faces of Tower Hamlets council for some perspective.” The government’s decision to place asylum seekers at Britannia International Hotel in Canary Wharf, Tower Hamlets has attracted intense anti-migrant protest since the summer, including from a group called the Pink Ladies who say they are concerned about safety. While this weekend’s Ukip march has been stopped, counter-protesters still plan to gather in Whitechapel on Saturday. Dave Rosenberg, who has run walking tours through the East End since 2007, including on local anti-fascist history, will be among them. “I think we owe it to our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents to continue that struggle in the East End,” said Rosenberg, 67. For Rosenberg, the ban on the march was a “double-edged sword” – “a relief to the most targeted communities”, but also “giving wider and wider powers to police to say who can demonstrate and where”. “There’s a very direct parallel with the 1930s,” he said. In 1936, the Public Order Act was introduced to inhibit Mosley’s British Union of Fascists. Mosley’s wasn’t the first anti-immigrant movement to target the area – back in 1901, the British Brothers’ League (BBL) launched itself with a 1,000-strong rally in the East End, with the slogan “England for the English” and targeting Russian and Polish Jewish migrants. For Rosenberg, the repeated battle against the far right in the East End reflects two different visions of working-class life – one diverse, the other homogenous. “It’s this sense that those organisations have had, from BBL to Ukip today, that this is ‘our territory’… and people are invaders and encroaching in our territory,” Rosenberg said. Last week, Safia Jama, the 47-year-old CEO of the charity Women’s Inclusive Team, was chairing a Stand Up to Racism meeting when it was disrupted by rightwing protesters. “I did not feel safe. I never ran out of somewhere so quickly,” she said. When she was a young girl, her father was attacked in Tower Hamlets and left disabled as a result. The community has seen “huge achievements” since: Brick Lane and Spitalfields have experienced profound regeneration – and gentrification – and Canary Wharf is a leading financial centre. While 62.7% of all residents in employment are in managerial or professional occupations, the borough has the highest rate of child poverty in the country, with about 27,000 people on the housing list, and about 15,000 people in overcrowded homes. With a median age of 30, it is the youngest borough in England and Wales, as well as one of the UK’s most socially and ethnically diverse areas. “This is our home. We’ve made it our home,” Jama said. “We’ve invested tears, sweat, blood, whatever it might be, we’ve really worked hard to create an environment that is beautiful.” But for months, tensions have been simmering in Tower Hamlets, as rightwingers have made its diversity the centre of a culture war. The latest escalation began in February, when Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe tweeted about dual language signs in English and Bengali at Whitechapel tube station. “This is London,” he wrote. “The station name should be in English, and in English only.” Elon Musk replied: “Yes”. By June, Robinson was complaining about bilingual children in Whitechapel, adding “a district once synonymous with Jack the Ripper and the Kray twins and home to the nation’s true cockneys, now this.” Lutfur Rahman, Tower Hamlets’ British Bengali mayor, described the online attack as “despicable”. Rahman has defied controversies to lead the borough repeatedly since 2008, with progressive social policies. All primary and secondary schoolchildren enjoy free school meals, the borough provides university bursaries and the education maintenance allowance for working-class teenagers and is investing, the leadership says, £700m in council homes, funded by “taxing wealth, and high business rates for big business”. Rahman said: “In the late 1980s and early 90s, parts of the borough were no-go areas for people of colour. Since then successive leaders have invested in the people of the borough – and it’s worked well for us. We have over 300,000 people, we don’t want anyone to feel left out. “Now, 90% of our residents say they get one with each other. I grew up in this borough, our white neighbours helped my mother, helped me when my father went to work. My mum couldn’t speak English, it was our neighbours, the community spirit of the East End, that got us through those difficult days in the 70s and 80s.” In September, the borough hosted a festival to celebrate this legacy, in a direct response to Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” rally in central London. New dual language signs were unveiled on the town hall – the restored former Royal London hospital – a snub to Lowe and Musk. Pearly kings and queens, a steel band, Celtic dancers, klezmer musicians, Bengali, Somali and Chinese acts performed and told stories of the East End through the ages, while a curry festival took place on Brick Lane, events attracting 25,000 people over two days. “The truth is, in the midst of all rancour and in the midst of all uncertainty, there is hope,” said Rev James Olanipekun, co-chair of the Tower Hamlets interfaith forum. “We are united and we are together.” Living in the borough has not been without incident for Olanipekun. Once, a brick was thrown at his wife’s car. “I didn’t look at it, I said nothing. After all, I was insured,” he said with a laugh. “Racism has a long history and Tower Hamlets, we’ve had a particular variant of it,” Robbins, a university lecturer who has seen off numerous far-right marches since United East End was created in 2010. “(But) now, what they’re saying is being echoed by the government, or the government in-waiting.”\",\n                \"author\": \"Chris Osuh and Geneva Abdul\",\n                \"category\": \"Politics\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/25/history-repeating-fight-against-far-right-in-london-east-end\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1faaae20d91a2188172fab789f5b47318590f03/70_0_1648_1319/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T12:04:23+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:38+00:00\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 170,\n                \"source\": \"theguardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Pennsylvania city divided over Trump as it reels from economic whiplash \",\n                \"description\": \"As Trump’s tariffs and funding cuts suspend projects in Erie, some residents view the changes as a necessary evil\",\n                \"content\": \"It was set to be the most expensive project that the beaten-down manufacturing sector of Erie, Pennsylvania, had seen in decades.

Mitch Hecht, founder of the company pursuing the project, announced that a Department of Energy loan crucial to the plant’s funding was put on hold as a result of Donald Trump’s policies, which “had a severe and immediate impact on our ability to move forward”. It was the latest bout of economic whiplash to strike the county on north-west Pennsylvania’s Lake Erie shoreline, just months after its voters helped return Trump to the White House. Those who backed the president say they are sticking with him, even as his administration’s spending cuts have upended projects and budgets and tariffs have created new uncertainties for businesses. Once reliably Democratic at the presidential level, Erie county has emerged as hotly contested territory ever since 2016, when Trump became the first Republican to win the area in 32 years. Joe Biden carried the county by a slim 1,417 votes four years later, but it flipped back to Trump in 2024 by nearly the same margin. “We’re set up in this moment for extreme growth over the next 15, 20, 30 years, and as we try to just hobble off the starting line, we’re just getting whacked over the head by these larger macro policies and intentional immigration policies that create an inflation environment,” said Drew Whiting, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation. The non-profit’s renovation efforts have helped open a food hall and new apartments and shops in what was once the poorest zip code in the US, and its latest project is a mixed-use space that could create 100 jobs and bring in up to $10m a year in tax revenue. But since the start of the year, costs of labor and materials have jumped 37%, which Whiting blamed on a dollar weakened by economic uncertainty, along with labor shortages worsened by Trump’s immigration crackdown. A short drive from downtown, a placard reading: “A recycling revolution is happening in Erie” standing outside a long-shuttered paper mill is the only sign remaining of the plastic waste facility that the startup International Recycling Group (IRG) planned to build there. Though environmental groups warned IRG’s plant would create more pollution and lead to garbage filling Lake Erie, projects intended to fight the climate crisis and address long-running problems such as how to dispose of plastic waste were priorities of the Biden administration, and last year, IRG announced it had received a $182m loan commitment from the energy department. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that paused disbursements of such funds, and by April of this year, Hecht had announced that the loan had been put on hold, and the project would be canceled. IRG did not respond to a request for comment, and the Department of Energy did not respond to an email sent during the government shutdown. Railing against “waste, fraud and abuse” in Washington, Trump has put on hold numerous federal programs. Erie’s food bank, Second Harvest, has lost $1m that would go towards food purchasing, or about 25% of their budget, due to such funding cuts, its CEO, Gregory Hall, said. Meanwhile, need for their assistance has only grown, climbing 43% in the past two to three years as food prices rose and local grocers went under. A deadlock in the state legislature over approving a budget, which began in July, has only worsened the financial situation. “It has been a plethora of different funding cuts, different programs canceled, that is truly having an impact on not only the amount of food, but the types and quality of food that we can provide to the neighbors in our region,” Hall said. Trump’s solution to the ills plaguing communities like Erie is tariffs, which he says will encourage businesses to bring jobs back to the US from overseas, and protect domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. Businesses are divided over how significant the levies are, and whether the turmoil they have brought will be worth it. “It’s greatly impacted profitability, but it’s also it’s leading to the product not getting harvested,” said Roger Schultz, a farmer outside Erie who said his largest markets for apples, Canada and Mexico, are far less interested in taking his crop this year because of the levies. He was skeptical that the president’s promises of new trade deals would lead to those markets reopening. “Fundamental changes have happened out there in the marketplace, and no amount of pleading or price cutting or, ‘Hey, won’t you try this,’ is going to get you back in that,” Schultz said. At the injection plastic firm Erie Molded Packaging, sales have risen 15% this year, and its president, Tom Tredway, said he is looking at expanding their factory, thanks in part to tax deductions for businesses included in Trump and the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While all of their suppliers and customers are in the US, the thin-gauge aluminum that is used in liners for their plastic containers is manufactured abroad, and tariffs have driven the prices higher. “It’s a nuisance more than anything,” he said. Jezree Friend, vice-president of the Manufacturer and Business Association, an Erie-based advocacy and training group, described the higher costs as a necessary evil. “It’s a growing pain that gets you now. I think a lot of the business owners recognize that and are actually OK with that, by what they’re telling me,” he said. When Second Harvest distributes groceries, people line up in their cars hours early out of concern that the food on hand may run out. Those who supported the president on a recent Wednesday said they were pleased with what he had done so far. “I think he stands up for the people. I think he’s doing right,” said Norm Francis, 81, who runs a business fixing stained glass. “Corporate greed”, he said, was to blame for food prices that had become increasingly unaffordable for him, but the tariffs were “the right thing to do”. Ahead of him in line was Sally Michalak, 73, a retiree who was counting on Trump’s deportation campaign to curb inflation. “He’s getting rid of the illegals, so once all that settles down, I think grocery prices will go down,” she said. As for his funding cuts, Michalak shrugged them off as a necessary component of transforming a government she viewed as broken. “It’s just one of these deals where, if the house burns down, you have to tear it down completely before you rebuild it, and that’s what he’s doing,” she said. Rebuilding was on the mind of Gary Horton, executive director of the Urban Erie Community Development Corporation, as he sat in the gymnasium of a shuttered elementary school not far from where IRG would have built its plant. Closed in 2012 as enrollment in the neighborhoods around it declined, the Burton school has been used by local police for active shooter drills that have left paint splatter on the walls and bullet casings on the floor. Two years ago, Horton’s group bought it and turned the grounds into a community garden, with plans to hopefully reopen the school if the neighborhood’s economy turned around, hopefully with the help of the plastics plant. “The success of it would have helped us here, but it would have also helped maybe cultivate an atmosphere where other developers or other owners of projects would do the same thing,” Horton said. Now that the project has been canceled, “the odds of doing something right now aren’t great,” Horton conceded. “But we still have the challenge, and we still have the opportunity.”\",\n                \"author\": \"Chris Stein in Erie, Pennsylvania \",\n                \"category\": \"US news\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/erie-pennsylvania-trump-policies\",\n                \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/55a31900949b3d809af6fa38e765887cf2ac26e2/724_0_6750_5398/500.jpg\",\n                \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T12:00:34+00:00\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:39+00:00\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"links\": {\n            \"first\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=1\",\n            \"last\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=12\",\n            \"prev\": null,\n            \"next\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=2\"\n        },\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"current_page\": 1,\n            \"from\": 1,\n            \"last_page\": 12,\n            \"links\": [\n                {\n                    \"url\": null,\n                    \"label\": \"&laquo; Previous\",\n                    \"page\": null,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=1\",\n                    \"label\": \"1\",\n                    \"page\": 1,\n                    \"active\": true\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=2\",\n                    \"label\": \"2\",\n                    \"page\": 2,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=3\",\n                    \"label\": \"3\",\n                    \"page\": 3,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=4\",\n                    \"label\": \"4\",\n                    \"page\": 4,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=5\",\n                    \"label\": \"5\",\n                    \"page\": 5,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=6\",\n                    \"label\": \"6\",\n                    \"page\": 6,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=7\",\n                    \"label\": \"7\",\n                    \"page\": 7,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=8\",\n                    \"label\": \"8\",\n                    \"page\": 8,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=9\",\n                    \"label\": \"9\",\n                    \"page\": 9,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=10\",\n                    \"label\": \"10\",\n                    \"page\": 10,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=11\",\n                    \"label\": \"11\",\n                    \"page\": 11,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=12\",\n                    \"label\": \"12\",\n                    \"page\": 12,\n                    \"active\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles?page=2\",\n                    \"label\": \"Next &raquo;\",\n                    \"page\": 2,\n                    \"active\": false\n                }\n            ],\n            \"path\": \"http://localhost:8000/api/articles\",\n            \"per_page\": 15,\n            \"to\": 15,\n            \"total\": 174\n        }\n    }\n}"

I’m not sticking up for the guy, but in my eyes, he was trying to do the right thing. He knew he was getting deported, but he didn’t know where he was going or how he should get there. He added that the officers had no interest in helping him, saying, “You’re released, you’re released”. Describing his feelings about the debacle Sim told Sky News: It’s scary how this has all unfolded, and how easily he’s been able to get out and then be around the public. He’s obviously not a secure man. He shouldn’t have been released and the fact there’s so many officers there – how come no one’s clocked it sooner?” He went on: “Someone here has messed up … I know someone has been taken off duty … But to me there’s got to be more people that allowed this to happen, not just one person …” Kebatu was freed by mistake at HMP Chelmsford on Friday morning instead of being sent to an immigration detention centre. He was wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be released on licence and handed a £76 discharge grant, the Telegraph reported on Saturday. Once at the station, a one mile walk from the prison, Kebatu bought a ticket to London at a cost of £20.90. A Greater Anglia rail worker told The Telegraph: “He got a ticket and then went straight through. We don’t think he did it on his phone. You can’t use your card at this station either. It’s not London. So he must have got a ticket and paid like anyone else. “My colleague who was here has given a statement to British Transport Police about what happened. They swarmed the place after. They spoke to people who were here.” The accidental release of the asylum seeker was a “mind-blowing” blunder, says the MP for Chelmsford. The Liberal Democrat MP Marie Goldman said on Saturday: “My mind has blown. How this could possibly happen?” She added: “It is obvious something has gone terribly, terribly wrong and we really need to understand what went wrong. “Crucially, we need to understand how to fix it.” Goldman also told the PA news agency she had been frustrated by a lack of communication from HMP Chelmsford’s governor, Mark Howard, and said she was “struggling” not to call for him to resign. Stephen Robinson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Chelmsford city council, said Kebatu must be located and deported “as soon as possible”. “This is outrageous,” he told BBC Breakfast. “Chelmsford prison is used to handling people who are coming and going because it’s mainly a remand centre, and so they should be used to dealing with this.” A delivery driver called Sim, who spoke to Hadush Kebatu at Chelmsford prison has told Sky News the “confused” offender was guided to the railway station by prison staff. Sim was delivering equipment to the prison on Friday when Kebatu was released in error instead of being handed over to immigration officials for deportation. The lorry driver explained to Sky News that Kebatu approached him and seemed to have no idea of where he was supposed to go. He came out of the airlock, and kept saying to the officers there, ‘Where am I going? What am I doing? I don’t know where I’m going and what I’m doing.’ He was holding a pack of paperwork in his arms, and his bag of bits … He knew he’d been deported. He came over to me and said, ‘I need you to help me.’ Sim, who still has the vehicle pass from the prison, said that after a while a member of staff directed the offender to Chelmsford station to catch a train to London, and “told him that he had to get on a train”. Police confirmed Kebatu was seen catching a train at Chelmsford railway station at 12.41pm on Friday. On Friday, Sir Keir Starmer called the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu “totally unacceptable”, adding: I am appalled that it has happened and it’s being investigated. The police are working urgently to track him down, and my Government is supporting them … This man must be caught and deported for his crimes. David Lammy said he was “livid on behalf of the public” and added that he had launched an investigation. Lammy also said on Friday that there was “no excuse” for the mistaken release, but that Labour had inherited “a collapsing prison system”. He said: Let us be clear, we inherited a collapsing prison system in which the last government was releasing people early and which our prisons were overflowing. And, indeed, we have a sentencing bill in parliament seeking to address that issue, and we have stabilised the system. But that can be no excuse for wrongly releasing an individual, a dangerous individual, into the community. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Kebatu’s release was “staggering incompetence” and called for a public inquiry. Chelmsford’s Liberal Democrat MP Marie Goldman told the PA news agency she had been frustrated by a lack of communication from HMP Chelmsford’s governor, Mark Howard, and said she was “struggling” not to call for him to resign. At this moment, there is very little we know about how Hadush Kebatu came to be mistakenly released. Prison Service sources said the release was down to human error. It is understood the prison officer who authorised the release has been removed from duties while an urgent investigation takes place. One prison source described it as a “disaster waiting to happen” because of the high volume of releases being processed by inexperienced staff, with dozens of prisoners serving different tariffs being released at the same time. A senior prison staffer told the BBC: “This is down to a series of mistakes probably because staff are overworked and in short supply. It’s not just one prison officer who’s to blame. That would be unfair”. Recent law changes mean that foreign criminals such as Kebatu can be removed from England and Wales after serving a shorter sentence than domestic criminals. Kebatu was automatically eligible for immediate removal as soon as he was sentenced because of the time he had already spent on remand. The number of prisoners released in error more than doubled in the year to March 2025, Government data has shown. Councillor Chris Whitbread, Leader of Epping Forest District Council has responded to the extraordinary news after the mistaken release of Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu. Councillor Whitbread said in a statement: I am shocked and appalled by the mistaken release of Hadush Kebatu. Frankly, I am at a loss to understand how such a grave error could occur. My thoughts are with the victim and her family at this deeply distressing time. They have shown immense courage, and they deserve our full support and protection. This is a serious failure of the justice system, and people will rightly be outraged. It is completely unacceptable. The public has a right to expect that those convicted of serious crimes remain securely in custody. Public safety must never be compromised. I sincerely hope Kebatu is located and returned to prison without delay. There must also be a full and transparent investigation into how this happened, and what safeguards will be put in place to ensure it never happens again.” Friday, 12:57 – The search for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu began after Essex police were informed by the Prison Service that there had been “an error”. Friday, 12:41 – The Greater Anglia London-bound train that Kebatu had boarded left Chelmsford and then called at Shenfield, according to train line data. Friday, 13:10 – The service stopped at Stratford where the Met Police say Kebatu disembarked. A police statement said that, “Officers worked throughout the night to track his movements, including scouring hours of CCTV footage, and this work continues today. “It is not lost on us that this situation is concerning to people, and we are committed to locating and arresting him as quickly as possible,” it added. Saturday, 11:30 – Responsibility for the manhunt was transferred from Essex police to the Metropolitan police. A former asylum seeker who was released from prison in error after sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl has been spotted “in the London area” after officers worked through the night to track his movements, Essex police said. The Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was jailed for 12 months in September for sexual assault and made the subject of a five-year sexual harm prevention order. The 41-year-old was meant to be sent to an immigration detention centre to be deported but was freed by mistake, it has emerged. Kebatu was found guilty of five offences last month after attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl twice, before sexually assaulting her, and sexually assaulting a woman and trying to kiss her too. He committed the offences just days after arriving in the UK on a small boat and taking up residence at the Bell hotel in Epping. His case triggered protests outside the hotel, which far-right activists sought to exploit, leading to assaults on police officers and 32 arrests. At his trial, the district judge Christopher Williams said Kebatu posed a “significant risk of reoffending” and sentenced him to 12 months in prison. The number of prisoners released in error more than doubled in the year to March 2025, Government data shows. A report by His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) said 262 prisoners were released in error from April 2024 to March 2025, up from 115 in the year to March 2024. HMPPS said in the report that releases in error “remain infrequent” and believes the rise is linked to changes in the law, and the early release scheme which Labour introduced in September 2024. Cmdr James Conway, of the Metropolitan police, said finding Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu is a “top priority” for the force. The manhunt is being led by an experienced senior investigating officer. He has teams from the Specialist Crime Command with expertise in tracking down wanted people at his disposal, as well as other resources from across the Met. We’ve confirmed that Kebatu got off the London-bound train at Stratford station. We are examining CCTV from that area and further afield, including on the transport network, to establish information about his subsequent movements. We will provide further updates when we can, but I hope the press and the public will understand why it would be unhelpful to the effectiveness of the manhunt if we were to provide a detailed running commentary. Anyone who sees Kebatu, or has information about his whereabouts, should call 999 immediately. The Metropolitan police has taken over a manhunt for convicted sex offender Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, as there is a “high level of confidence” that the asylum seeker is in the London area. Kebatu, who was released in error from HMP Chelmsford on Friday, boarded a train for London and got off at Stratford station, the force said. As a result, the manhunt was transferred from Essex police to the Met shortly after 11.30am on Saturday.\",\n        \"author\": \"Sarah Haque\",\n        \"category\": \"UK news\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/oct/25/hadush-gerberslasie-kebatu-manhunt-met-police-sex-offender-london-latest-news\",\n        \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/521cda532783a48e7207a01affc98bf50e82d0d6/1032_439_2150_1720/500.jpg\",\n        \"published_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:32+00:00\",\n        \"created_at\": \"2025-10-25T14:07:36+00:00\"\n    }\n}"
